<blockquote>
<p>Physics 1.1, 185a13&ndash;20 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>We, on the other hand, must take for granted that the things
that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in
motion—which is indeed made plain by induction. Moreover,
no one is bound to solve every kind of difficulty that may be
[15] raised, but only as many as are drawn falsely from the
principles of the science: it is not our business to refute those
that do not arise in this way; just as it is the duty of the
geometer to refute the squaring of the circle by means of
segments, but it is not his duty to refute Antiphon’s proof. At
the same time the holders of the theory of which we are
speaking do incidentally raise physical questions, though
nature is not their subject; so it will perhaps be as well to
spend a few words on them, especially as [20] the inquiry is
not without scientific interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[F8 ] . . . Only one tale is left of the way:
that it is; and on this are posted
very many signs, that [i] what-is is ungenerated and imperishable,
[ii] a whole of one kind, [iii] unperturbed and [iv] complete.
[i] Never was it, nor shall it be, since it now is, all together,
one, continuous. For what birth would you seek of it?
Where [or: how] , whence did it grow? Not from what-is-not will I
allow
you to say or to think; for it is not sayable or thinkable
that it is not. And what need would have stirred it
later or earlier, starting from nothing, to grow?
Thus it must be completely or not at all.
Nor ever from what-is-not will the strength of faith allow
anything to come to be beside it. Wherefore neither to come to be
nor to perish did Justice permit it by loosening its shackles,
but she holds it fast. And the decision concerning these things
comes to this:
it is or it is not. Thus the decision is made, as is necessary,
to leave the one way unthought, unnamed - for it is not a true
way - the other to be and to be true.
And how would what-is be hereafter? How would it have come
to be?
For if it has come to be, it is not, and similarly if it is ever about
ro k
Thus coming to be is quenched and perishing unheard of.
[ii] Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike,
nor is there any more here, which would keep it from holding
together,
nor any less, but it is all full of what-is.
Thus it is all continuous, for what-is cleaves to what-is.
[iii] Further, motionless in the limits of great bonds
it is without starting and stopping, since coming to be and
perishing
wandered very far away, and true faith banished them.
Remaining the same in the same by itself it lies
and thus it remains steadfast there; for mighty Necessity
holds it in the bonds of a limit, which confines it round about.
[iv] Wherefore it is not right for what-is to be incomplete;
for it is not needy; if it were' it would lack everything.
The same thing is for thinking and is wherefore there is thought.
For not without what-is, to which it is directed,
will you find thought. For nothing else &lt; either&gt; i s nor shall be
beside what-is, since Fate shackled it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[F20] I shall speak a double tale: at one time they grew to be one alone
from many, at another time it grew apart to be many from one.
Double is the birth of mortal things, and double the demise;
for the confluence of all things begets and destroys the one [generation] ,
while the other in turn, having been nurtured while things were
growing apart, fled away.
And these things never cease continually alternating,
at one time all coming together into one by Love,
at another time each being borne apart by the enmity of Strife.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[F15] Everything else has a portion of everything, but mind is boundless,
autonomous, and mixed with no object, but it is alone all by itself. If it were
not by itself, but had been mixed with something else, it would have a portion
of all objects, if it had been mixed with any; for there is a portion of everything
in everything, as I said earlier [F12]. And the things mixed with it would hinder
it from ruling any object in the way it does when it is alone by itself. For it
is the finest of all objects and the purest, and it exercises complete oversight
over everything and prevails above all. And all things that have soul, both the
larger and the smaller, these does mind rule. And of the whole revolution did
mind take control, so that it revolved in the beginning. And first it began from
a small revolution, now it is revolving more, and it will revolve still more. And
things mixed together, things separated, and things segregated, all these did
mind comprehend. And the kinds of things that were to be - such as were but
now are not, all that now are, and such as will be - all these did mind set in
order, as well as this revolution, with which the stars, the sun, the moon, the
air, and the aether which were being separated now revolve. For this revolution
made things separate. And from the rare is separated the dense, from the cold
the hot, from the dark the bright, and from the wet the dry. But there are many
portions of many things. And nothing is completely separated nor segregated
the one from the other except mind. Mind is all alike, both the larger and the
smaller. No other thing is like anything else, but each one is and was most
manifestly those things of which it has the most.</p>

<p>When a simple thing is said to become something, in one case it survives [10] through the process, in the other it does not. For the man remains a man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas what is not musical or is unmusical does not survive, either simply or combined with the subject.</p>

<dt>Question</dt>
<dd>In which simple case of coming-to-be does &ldquo;that which becomes&rdquo; survive (lit., &ldquo;remain, persist&rdquo;; <em>hupomenon</em>)?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Answer:
-   <strong>Socrates</strong> survives coming to be musical.</p>
<pre><code>-   **The Non-Musical** does not survive coming to be musical.

<h4 id="two-conditions-on-coming-to-be">Two Conditions on Coming to Be</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 190a13&ndash;17 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>These distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various cases of becoming in the way we are describing that (1) there must always be an underlying [15] something, namely that which becomes, and (2) that this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one. (By ‘in form’ I mean the same as ‘in account’.)</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Subject Condition (SC)</dt>
<dd>In every case of coming to be, there must be some underlying subject, <em>s</em>, such that it is true &lsquo;<em>s</em> comes to be&hellip;&rsquo;.</dd>
<dt>Persistance Condition (PC)</dt>
<dd>In every case of coming to be, the underlying subject must remain <strong>one in number</strong>, although not <strong>one in form</strong> or <strong>logos</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Cf. Aristotle&rsquo;s account of numerical unity in <em>Metaphysics</em> Δ:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Metaphysics</em> Δ 6, 1017a30&ndash;34 (Ross tr.)</p>
<p>Again, some things are one in number, others in species,
others in genus, others by analogy; in number those whose
matter is one, in species [= form] those whose formula is one, in genus
those to which the same figure of predication applies, by
analogy those which are related as a third thing is to a fourth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="varieties-of-coming-to-be">Varieties of Coming to Be</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Things are said to come to be in different ways. In some cases we do not use the expression ‘come to be’, but ‘come to be so-and-so’. Only substances are said to come to be without qualification.</p>

<h4 id="applying-sc-and-pc">Applying SC and PC</h4>
<ul>
<li>Subject Condition applies to both qualified and unqualified coming to be.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 190a33&ndash;b5 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>Now in all cases other than substance it is plain that there must be something underlying, namely, that which becomes. For when a thing comes to be of such a quantity or quality or in such a relation, time, or place, a subject is always [35] presupposed, since substance alone is not predicated of another subject, but everything else of substance.</p>
<p>But that substances too, and anything that can be said to be without [190 b 1] qualification, come to be from some underlying thing, will appear on examination. For we find in every case something that underlies from which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals and plants from seed.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Question</dt>
<dd>What about PC?
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualified Coming to Be:</strong> Of course! It is the substance, or <em>tode ti</em>:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 190b24&ndash;28 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>Now the subject is one numerically, though it is two in form. (For there is the man, the gold—in general, the countable <strong>matter</strong>; for it is more of the nature of a [25] ‘this’, and what comes to be does not come from it accidentally; the privation, on the other hand, and the contrariety are accidental.)</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Unqualified Coming to Be</dt>
<dd>The &ldquo;matter&rdquo; of substance/subject of unqualified coming to be is knowable on analogy to the matter of qualified comings to be:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 191a9&ndash;12 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>The underlying nature can be known by analogy. For as the bronze is to the [10] statue, the wood to the bed, or the matter and the formless before receiving form to any thing which has form, so is the underlying nature to substance, i.e. the ‘this’ or existent.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Initial formulation of <strong>matter</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.9, 192a31&ndash;33 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be, and which persists in the result, not accidentally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="resolution-to-the-puzzle">Resolution to the Puzzle</h4>
<ul>
<li>All coming to be is complex in that which comes to be:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 190b11&ndash;15 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>Thus, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is always complex. There is, on the one hand, something which comes to be, and again something which becomes that—the latter in two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the opposite I mean the unmusical, by the subject, man; and similarly I call the absence of shape or form or order the opposite, and the bronze or stone or gold the [15] subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What comes to be is the <strong>Form</strong> (<em>morphē</em>), e.g. Musical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What comes to be is always a &ldquo;compound&rdquo; (<em>suntheton</em>) involving:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Subject</strong> (<em>hupokeimenon</em>), e.g. Socrates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Opposite</strong> or <strong>Privation</strong>, e.g. Non-Musical</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, there are (depending on how one describes the coming to be) either two or three principles:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 190b29&ndash;191a2 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the contraries are the [30] principles—say for example the musical and the unmusical, the hot and the cold, the tuned and the untuned—and a sense in which they are not, since it is impossible for the contraries to be acted on by each other. But this difficulty also is solved by the fact that what underlies is different from the contraries; for it is itself not a [35] contrary. The principles therefore are, in a way, not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two; nor yet precisely two, since there is a difference of [191 a 1] being, but three. For to be man is different from to be unmusical, and to be unformed from to be bronze.</p>

<p>The first of those who studied philosophy &hellip; say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible.</p>
<p>For what is cannot come to be [30] (because it is already), and</p>
<p>from what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must be underlying).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If <em>x</em> comes to be, it must come to be either</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor, but qua housebuilder, and turns gray, not qua [5] doctor, but qua dark-haired. On the other hand he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we are using words most appropriately when we say that a doctor does something or undergoes something, or becomes something from being a doctor, if he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor. Clearly then also to come to be so-and-so from what is not means ‘qua what is not’.</p>

<li>
<p>Disarming the Second Horn</p>
<p>Recall: that which comes to be is complex, including both <strong>subject</strong> (which survives as a constituent of that which comes to be) and <strong>privation</strong> (which is something which is not and does not survive).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.8, 191b13&ndash;17 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless we maintain that a thing may come to be from what is not in a qualified sense, i.e. accidentally. For a [15] thing comes to be from the privation, which in its own nature is something which is not—this not surviving as a constituent of the result. Yet this causes surprise, and it is thought impossible that something should come to be in the way described from what is not.</p>

<p>Disarming the First Horn</p>
<p>Recall: the subject in every case comes to be <em>F</em> from being <em>not-F</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.8, 191b17&ndash;25 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>In the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from what is, and that what is does not come to be except accidentally. In that way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus, suppose a dog to come to be from a dog, or a horse [20] from a horse. The dog would then, it is true, come to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a certain kind) but not as animal, for that is already there. But if anything is to become an animal, not accidentally, it will not be from animal; and if what is, not from what is—nor from what is not either, for it has been explained that [25] by ‘from what is not’ we mean qua what is not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.8, 191b27&ndash;29 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>This then is one way of solving the difficulty. Another consists in pointing out that the same things can be spoken of in terms of potentiality and actuality. But this has been done with greater precision elsewhere.</p>
