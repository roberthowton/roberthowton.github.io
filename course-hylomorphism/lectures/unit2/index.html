<blockquote>
<p>Physics 1.1, 185a13&ndash;20 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>We, on the other hand, must take for granted that the things
that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in
motion—which is indeed made plain by induction. Moreover,
no one is bound to solve every kind of difficulty that may be
[15] raised, but only as many as are drawn falsely from the
principles of the science: it is not our business to refute those
that do not arise in this way; just as it is the duty of the
geometer to refute the squaring of the circle by means of
segments, but it is not his duty to refute Antiphon’s proof. At
the same time the holders of the theory of which we are
speaking do incidentally raise physical questions, though
nature is not their subject; so it will perhaps be as well to
spend a few words on them, especially as [20] the inquiry is
not without scientific interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[F8 ] . . . Only one tale is left of the way:
that it is; and on this are posted
very many signs, that [i] what-is is ungenerated and imperishable,
[ii] a whole of one kind, [iii] unperturbed and [iv] complete.
[i] Never was it, nor shall it be, since it now is, all together,
one, continuous. For what birth would you seek of it?
Where [or: how] , whence did it grow? Not from what-is-not will I
allow
you to say or to think; for it is not sayable or thinkable
that it is not. And what need would have stirred it
later or earlier, starting from nothing, to grow?
Thus it must be completely or not at all.
Nor ever from what-is-not will the strength of faith allow
anything to come to be beside it. Wherefore neither to come to be
nor to perish did Justice permit it by loosening its shackles,
but she holds it fast. And the decision concerning these things
comes to this:
it is or it is not. Thus the decision is made, as is necessary,
to leave the one way unthought, unnamed - for it is not a true
way - the other to be and to be true.
And how would what-is be hereafter? How would it have come
to be?
For if it has come to be, it is not, and similarly if it is ever about
ro k
Thus coming to be is quenched and perishing unheard of.
[ii] Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike,
nor is there any more here, which would keep it from holding
together,
nor any less, but it is all full of what-is.
Thus it is all continuous, for what-is cleaves to what-is.
[iii] Further, motionless in the limits of great bonds
it is without starting and stopping, since coming to be and
perishing
wandered very far away, and true faith banished them.
Remaining the same in the same by itself it lies
and thus it remains steadfast there; for mighty Necessity
holds it in the bonds of a limit, which confines it round about.
[iv] Wherefore it is not right for what-is to be incomplete;
for it is not needy; if it were' it would lack everything.
The same thing is for thinking and is wherefore there is thought.
For not without what-is, to which it is directed,
will you find thought. For nothing else &lt; either&gt; i s nor shall be
beside what-is, since Fate shackled it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[F20] I shall speak a double tale: at one time they grew to be one alone
from many, at another time it grew apart to be many from one.
Double is the birth of mortal things, and double the demise;
for the confluence of all things begets and destroys the one [generation] ,
while the other in turn, having been nurtured while things were
growing apart, fled away.
And these things never cease continually alternating,
at one time all coming together into one by Love,
at another time each being borne apart by the enmity of Strife.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[F15] Everything else has a portion of everything, but mind is boundless,
autonomous, and mixed with no object, but it is alone all by itself. If it were
not by itself, but had been mixed with something else, it would have a portion
of all objects, if it had been mixed with any; for there is a portion of everything
in everything, as I said earlier [F12]. And the things mixed with it would hinder
it from ruling any object in the way it does when it is alone by itself. For it
is the finest of all objects and the purest, and it exercises complete oversight
over everything and prevails above all. And all things that have soul, both the
larger and the smaller, these does mind rule. And of the whole revolution did
mind take control, so that it revolved in the beginning. And first it began from
a small revolution, now it is revolving more, and it will revolve still more. And
things mixed together, things separated, and things segregated, all these did
mind comprehend. And the kinds of things that were to be - such as were but
now are not, all that now are, and such as will be - all these did mind set in
order, as well as this revolution, with which the stars, the sun, the moon, the
air, and the aether which were being separated now revolve. For this revolution
made things separate. And from the rare is separated the dense, from the cold
the hot, from the dark the bright, and from the wet the dry. But there are many
portions of many things. And nothing is completely separated nor segregated
the one from the other except mind. Mind is all alike, both the larger and the
smaller. No other thing is like anything else, but each one is and was most
manifestly those things of which it has the most.</p>

<p>These distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various cases of becoming in the way we are describing that there must always be an underlying [15] something, namely that which becomes, and that this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one. (By ‘in form’ I mean the same as ‘in account’.)&hellip;</p>

<li>All coming to be is complex in that which comes to be:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 190b11&ndash;15 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>Thus, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is always complex. There is, on the one hand, something which comes to be, and again something which becomes that—the latter in two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the opposite I mean the unmusical, by the subject, man; and similarly I call the absence of shape or form or order the opposite, and the bronze or stone or gold the [15] subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What comes to be is the <strong>Form</strong> (<em>morphē</em>), e.g. Musical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What comes to be is always a &ldquo;compound&rdquo; (<em>suntheton</em>) involving:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Subject</strong> (<em>hupokeimenon</em>), e.g. Socrates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Opposite</strong> or <strong>Privation</strong>, e.g. Non-Musical</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, there are (depending on how one describes the coming to be) either two or three principles:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.7, 190b29&ndash;191a2 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the contraries are the [30] principles—say for example the musical and the unmusical, the hot and the cold, the tuned and the untuned—and a sense in which they are not, since it is impossible for the contraries to be acted on by each other. But this difficulty also is solved by the fact that what underlies is different from the contraries; for it is itself not a [35] contrary. The principles therefore are, in a way, not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two; nor yet precisely two, since there is a difference of [191 a 1] being, but three. For to be man is different from to be unmusical, and to be unformed from to be bronze.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 1.8, 191b13&ndash;17 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)</p>
<p>We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless we maintain that a thing may come to be from what is not in a qualified sense, i.e. accidentally. For a [15] thing comes to be from the privation, which in its own nature is something which is not—this not surviving as a constituent of the result.

<p>In the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from what is, and that what is does not come to be except accidentally. In that way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus, suppose a dog to come to be from a dog, or a horse [20] from a horse. The dog would then, it is true, come to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a certain kind) but not as animal, for that is already there. But if anything is to become an animal, not accidentally, it will not be from animal; and if what is, not from what is—nor from what is not either, for it has been explained that [25] by ‘from what is not’ we mean qua what is not.</p>

<p>Our task now is:</p>
<ol>
<li>to pick out the causes and definitions of generation and corruption common to all those things which come to be and perish in the course of nature; and</li>
<li>secondly to investigate growth and alteration, asking what each of them is, and whether we are to suppose that the nature of alteration and generation is the same or different, as they are certainly distinguished in name.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>GC</em> 1.2 317a17&ndash;26 (Williams tr.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, coming to be simpliciter, i.e. absolutely, is not defined by aggregation and segregation, as some say; nor is change in what is continuous the same as alteration. This is just where all the mistakes are made. Coming to be and ceasing to be simpliciter occur, not in virtue of aggregation and segregation, but when something changes from this to that as a whole. These people think that all such change is alteration, but there is in fact a distinction. <strong>For within the substratum there is something which corresponds to the definition and something which corresponds to the matter. When, therefore, the change takes place in these it will be generation or corruption: when it takes place in the affections, accidentally, it will be alteration.</strong></p>

<p>Answers 2 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is generation/corruption without qualification (or absolutely, or <em>simpliciter</em>)? Why is it that some coming to be is absolute, while some is not?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>GC</em> 1.3, 317b12&ndash;34 (Williams tr.)</p>
<p>The dilemmas that arise concerning these matters and their solutions have been set out at greater length elsewhere, but it should now again be said by way of summary that in one way it is from what is not that a thing comes to be simpliciter, though in another way it is always from what is; for that which is potentially but is not actually must pre-exist, being described in both these ways.</p>
<p>But even when these distinctions have been made, there remains a question of remarkable difficulty, which we must take up once again, namely, how is coming to be simpliciter possible, whether from what is potentially or some other way. One might well wonder whether there is coming to be of substance and the individual, as opposed to quality, quantity, and place (and the same question arises in the case of ceasing to be). For if something comes to be, clearly there will exist potentially, not actually, some substance from which the coming to be will arise and into which that which ceases to be has to change. Now will any of the others belong to this actually?</p>
<p>What I mean is: Will that which is only potentially individual and existent, but neither individual nor existent simpliciter, have any quality or quanity or place?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If it has none of these, but all of them potentially, (a) that which in this sense is not will consequently be separable, and further, (b) the principal and perpetual fear of the early philosophers will be realized, namely, the coming to be of something from nothing previously existing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if being individual and a substance are not going to belong to it while some of the other things we have mentioned are, the affections will, as we have remarked, be separable from the substances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>If there is unqualified generation/corruption, why does it persist? Why doesn&rsquo;t the total quantity of bodies continually shrink into non-existence?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>GC</em> 1.3, 318b33&ndash;319a3 (Williams tr.)</p>
<p>We have now stated the reason why there is such a thing as generation simpliciter, which is the corruption of something, and such a thing as corruption simpliciter, which is the generation of something: it is due to a difference of matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>either in respect of its being substance or not being substance,</li>
<li>or in respect of its being more or less so,</li>
<li>or because in the one case the matter from which or to which the change takes place is more perceptible and in the other case less perceptible.</li>

<h3 id="distinguishing-absolute-generation-from-alteration--gc-1-dot-4">Distinguishing Absolute Generation from Alteration (<em>GC</em> 1.4)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>GC</em> 1.4, 319b8&ndash;21 (Williams tr.)</p>
<p>The substratum is one thing and the affection whose nature is to be predicated of the substratum another, and either of them can change.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Alteration</dt>
<dd>So it is alteration when the substratum remains, being something perceptible [i.e., a <em>tode ti</em> or individual] but change occurs in the affections which belong to it, whether these are contraries or intermediates. For example, the body is well then ill, but remains the same body; the bronze is now round, now a thing with corners, but remains the same [sc. bronze].</dd>
<dt>Generation</dt>
<dd>When, however, the whole changes without anything perceptible remaining as the same substratum, but the way:
<ul>
<li>the seed changes entirely into blood,</li>
<li>water into air,</li>
<li>or air entirely into water,</li>
</ul>
<p>then, when we have this sort of thing, it is a case of generation (and corrpution of something else); particularly if the change takes place from what is imperceptible to what is perceptible either by touch or by the other senses, as when water is generated or corrupts into air, since air is&mdash;near enough&mdash;imperceptible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In these cases [sc. of generation] if some affection that is one of a pair of contraries remains the same in the thing generated as it was in the thing that has perished, e.g. when water comes from air, if both are transparent or &lt;wet, but not&gt; cold, this must not have the other, the terminus of the change, as an affection of itself. Otherwise it will be alteration.</p>

<dt>Upshot of [I]</dt>
<dd>On pain of being cases of alteration, it cannot be supposed that the persisting subject of elemental transformations is the quality that inheres in both what comes to be and what perishes.</dd>
<dt>Upshot of [II]</dt>
<dd>Despite the superficial similarity in the locutions (1) &ldquo;the musical person comes to be the unmusical person&rdquo; and (2) &ldquo;the hot moist comes to be the cold moist&rdquo;, they describe two ontologically distinct changes:
<ul>
<li>
<p>In (1), the affections <em>musical</em> and <em>unmusical</em> are affections of the person <em>as such</em>, which therefore persists through the alteration as subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In (2), however, the affections <em>hot</em> and <em>cold</em> are affections of the moist only <em>incidentally</em>, in the way the pale thing (the person who happens to be pale) is musical or unmusical.
