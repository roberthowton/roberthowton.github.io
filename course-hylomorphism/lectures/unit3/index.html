      <h2 id="3-dot-1-nature-and-causation">3.1 | Nature and Causation</h2>
<p>The unity of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> is a matter of scholarly controversy, but it seems clear that <em>Physics</em> 2&ndash;4 (at least) constitute a continuous discussion of <strong>nature</strong> (<em>phusis</em>). <em>Physics</em> 2 provides the foundation of this discussion, defending a definition of nature as well as an enumeration of the kinds of cause operative in the things that come about by or in accordance with nature.</p>
<h3 id="a-division-among-beings">A Division Among Beings</h3>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1 begins with a distinction among beings (<em>ta onta</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 192b8&ndash;23 (RFH quasi-literal translation)</p>
<p>Among the things that are (<em>ta onta</em>), some are by nature (<em>phusei</em>), while others are due to other causes (<em>aitia</em>). By nature are animals and their parts; plants; and simple bodies like earth, fire, air, and water (for we say that these and things like them are by nature); and all of these plainly differ from those things which are not constituted by nature. <strong>For each of these [which are constituted by nature] has in itself a principle (<em>archē</em>) of change and rest, some [a principle of change] in respect of place, some in respect of growth and decay, and some in respect of alteration.</strong></p>
<p>By contrast, a bed, or cloak, or anything else of that sort does not have an innate impulse for change, [at least] not <em>qua</em> satisfying these descriptions and to the extent that they are products of craft (<em>technē</em>). However, insofar as they are made of stone or earth, or a mixture of the two, to that extent they do [have an innate impulse for change], since <strong>nature is a kind of principle and cause of changing and resting in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not accidentally</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Here Aristotle divides <em>ta onta</em> (exhaustively?) into two kinds:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Those that are (what they are) by nature, which, as the sort of things they are, have an internal causal principle of change and rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those that are (what they are) not by nature, which do not, as the sort of things they are, have an internal causal principle of change and rest, but come about from other causes (e.g., craft).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nature-as-a-principle-of-change">Nature as a Principle of Change</h3>
<p>What distinguishes things that are by nature from things that are due to other causes (including craft) is the presence of a certain <em>internal</em> cause and source of change and rest, which Aristotle identifies as <strong>nature</strong>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Nature</dt>
<dd>A causal source (principle) of change/rest internal to what it belongs to primarily <em>in virtue of itself (per se), i.e. not accidentally</em>.
<ul>
<li>The qualification <em>in virtue of itself</em> or <em>non-accidentally</em> refers to the connection between what is said to be &ldquo;by nature&rdquo; and what the nature in question is said to be predicated of:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 192b23&ndash;32 (RFH quasi-literal translation)</p>
<p>I mean by &ldquo;not accidentally&rdquo; that, for instance, although a doctor might be a cause of health in himself, he nevertheless has skill in medicine not to the extent that he is healed; rather, the doctor just <em>happens</em> to be the same as the person who is healed. Indeed, this is why the two [sc. doctor and patient] can be separated from one another. Circumstances are similar with each of the other things that have been made: none of them have the source of production in themselves. Rather, for some [the cause] is present in other things and comes from without, such as a house and other handmade products, while for others it is present in themselves but not in virtue of themselves&mdash;whatever comes to be a cause of itself accidentally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="questions-for-aristotle-s-definition">Questions for Aristotle&rsquo;s definition:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s the order of explanation between the division of beings and the definition of nature? Do we take the division as given and posit the presence of nature to explain it, or is it the other way around? (Cf. 193a3 ff.: &ldquo;That there is such as thing as nature would be ludicrous to try to show&hellip;&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For A., nature is a &ldquo;causal principle&rdquo;, both an <em>archē</em> and a cause (<em>aition</em>, <em>aitia</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>How does nature (understood as an <em>archē</em>) relate to the <em>archai</em> of natural beings discussed in <em>Physics</em> 1?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 293b18&ndash;21 (RFH tr.)</p>
<p>Now, both form and nature are double, since privation too is in a way form. But whether or not privation and opposition of a sort are concerned with unqualified generation, we will have to inquire later.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How does nature operate as a cause? (Cf. <em>Physics</em> 2.3: cause is said in many ways&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nature-as-form-and-matter">Nature as Form and Matter</h3>
<p>One step toward answering these questions is to observe that, in <em>Physics</em> 2.1, A. identifies nature with both <em>substance-</em> and <em>subjecthood</em>.</p>
<h4 id="nature-as-substance-and-subject">Nature as Substance and Subject</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 192b32&ndash;34 (RFH quasi-literal translation)</p>
<p>Nature, then, is what we said, and everything that has such as principle has a nature. All of these, moreover, are substances (<em>ousiai</em>), since each is a kind of subject (<em>hupokeimenon ti</em>), and nature is always present in a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="nature-as-matter">Nature as Matter</h4>
<p>Because all nature is present in a subject, and (as we&rsquo;ve seen) matter is a subject, it is only natural to suppose that the nature of each thing corresponds to its <em>matter</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 193a9&ndash;17 (RFH rough trans.)</p>
<p>The nature and substance of things in which nature is present seem to be that which exists primary in each, <namely what is> unformed in virtue of itself, [so that] for instance wood would be the nature of a bed and bronze of a statue. As a sign of this Antiphon says that if you bury a bed and the rotting wood acquired the capacity (<em>dunamis</em>) to send up a shoot, what would come about would not be a bed but wood, which shows that what exists accidentally is the arrangment according to convention and craft [sc. the bed], but the substance is the other [sc. the wood], which also remains continuously and suffers these [changes in arrangement].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As A. makes clear, this line of reasoning terminates in the conclusion that the elements are the nature of things, for if wood is the nature of the bed, and wood stands (e.g.) to earth as the bed to the wood, then earth would be the nature of wood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 193a22&ndash;28 (Charlton tr.)</p>
<p>Hence fire, earth, air, and water have been held to be the nature of things, some people choosing just one for this role, some several, and some making use of all. Those who fix on some such element or elements represent it or them as the entire reality, and say that other things are merely affections, states, or dispositions; and these elements are all held to be imperishable in that they do not change out of themselves, whilst other things come to be and pass away as often as you please.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="nature-as-form">Nature as Form</h4>
<p>For A., however, nature can <em>also</em> refer to the form (<em>morphē</em>) and <em>logos</em> of each thing. Aristotle offers three arguments for this conclusion:</p>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analogy with the Products of Craft</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 193a28&ndash;b5 (Charlton tr.)</p>
<p>That is one way of using the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo;: for</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the primary underlying matter in each case, of things which have in themselves a source of their movements and changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also used for the shape and form which accords with a thing&rsquo;s account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>[Argument for 2]</strong> Just as that which is in accordance with art and artificial is called art, so that which is in accordance with nature and natural is called nature. And as in the one case we would not yet say that a thing is at all in accordance with art, or that it is [in accordance with] art, if it is a bed only in possibility, and has not yet the form of a bed, so with things constituted naturally: that which is flesh or bone only in possibility, before it acquires the form which accords with the account by which we define what flesh or bone is, does not yet have its proper nature, and is not a thing due to nature. So there is another way of speaking, according to which nature is the shape and form of things which have in themselves a source of their changes, something which is not separable except in respect of its account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument proceeds as follows:</p>
<p>P1
: We use &ldquo;nature&rdquo; in the same way that we use &ldquo;art&rdquo; (or &ldquo;craft&rdquo;, <em>technē</em>)</p>
<p>P2
: We say things are (what they are) in accordance with art only when they <em>actually</em> possess the form imposed on them by the relevant art.
-   <strong>Example:</strong> Wood that is <em>potentially</em> a bed is not yet in accordance with art; only when it <em>actually</em> has the form of a bed.</p>
<p>C
: <em>So</em>, by analogy, we say things are (what they are) in accordance with nature only when they <em>actually</em> possess &ldquo;the form which accords with the account by which we define&rdquo; what it is.
-   <strong>Example:</strong> What is <em>potentially</em> flesh or bone is not yet in accordance with nature [= the nature of flesh/bone?]; only when it <em>actually</em> has the relevant form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parity of Reasoning</p>
<p>As A. suggests in the previous argument, nature is also &ldquo;the shape and form of things which have in themselves a source of their changes, something which is not separable except in respect of its account&rdquo; (on which see <em>Physics</em> 2.2). With the next argument, A. begins to make clear in what sense form can operate as a source of change.</p>
<p>The argument attempts to argue by <strong>parity of reasoning</strong> with Antiphon&rsquo;s bed argument earlier in the chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 193b8&ndash;12 (RFH tr.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, a human comes to be from a human, but not a bed from a bed. This is also why people say the shape is not nature but rather the wood, because if it grew it would not be a bed that came to be but wood. Hence if this is nature, so too must the form be nature, since human comes from human.</p>

<p>Nature as End of Change</p>
<p>In different ways, then, both nature-as-form and nature-as-matter seem to have a causal role in the origin and source of natural changes. Additionally, nature-as-form has a role to play as the end towards which a natural change proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.1, 193b&ndash;18 (RFH tr.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, nature spoken of as coming-to-be is a path into nature (<em>hodos eis phusis</em>). This is not like the practice of medicine, which is said to be a path, not into medicine, but to health. The reason is that the practice of medicine must not proceed to medicine, but from it, whereas nature does not stand to nature in this way. To the contrary, what grows, <em>qua</em> growing, proceeds from something into something. What, then, is it that grows? It is not that from which, but rather that into which, it grows. Therefore form is nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note
: &ldquo;nature&rdquo; (<em>phusis</em>) derives from the Greek word for &ldquo;grow&rdquo; (<em>phuein</em>).</p>
<p>A. makes this point a bit more clearly in <em>Physics</em> 2.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>194a28&ndash;33 (RFH rough tr.)</p>
<p>Nature is an end (<em>telos</em>) and that for the sake of which (<em>hou heneka</em>), for when in a continuous change there is some end, this [sc. the end] is the last and that for the sake of which. For this reason too the poet was ridiculous to say &ldquo;he has reached the end for whose sake he was born&rdquo;. For not everything which is last should be considered the end, but rather the best.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nature-as-cause">Nature as Cause</h3>
<p>For A., then, nature, understood as a principle of change, is &ldquo;double&rdquo; (<em>dichōs</em>), both form and matter. The two senses, however, are not equal, since for A. form must be considered <em>more</em> nature than matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>193b6&ndash;8 (RFH tr.)</p>
<p>This [sc. form, morphē?] is nature rather than the matter. For each thing is more property said [to be what it is] when it is actually, rather than potentially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is this double conception of nature reflected in A.&rsquo;s idea that nature is a kind of <em>cause</em>? To answer this question, we need to turn to <em>Physics</em> 2.3, where A. outlines the different ways in which things are said to be a cause (<em>aitios</em>, <em>aition</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Physics</em> 2.3, 194b23&ndash;195a3 (Charlton tr.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>According to one way of speaking, that out of which as a constituent a thing comes to be is called a cause; for example, the bronze and the silver and their genera would be the causes respectively of a statue and a loving-cup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to another, the form or model is a cause; this is the account of what the being would be, and its genera—thus the cause of an octave is the ratio of two to one, and more generally number—and the parts which come into the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, there is the primary source of the change or the staying unchanged: for example, the man who has deliberated is a cause, the father is a cause of the child, and in general that which makes something of that which is made, and that which changes something of that which is changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And again, a thing may be a cause as the end. That is what something is for, as health might be what a walk is for. On account of what does he walk? We answer &lsquo;To keep fit&rsquo; and think that, in saying that, we have given the cause. And anything which, the change being effected by something else, comes to be on the way to the end, as slimness, purging, drugs, and surgical instruments come to be as means to health: all these are for the end, but differ in that the former are works [or functions, <em>erga</em> ] and the latter tools [ <em>organa</em> ].</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>How nature-as-form and nature-as-matter map on to the notion of <em>cause</em> in these senses is an important question for the remainder of <em>Physics</em> 2. We&rsquo;ll pick up with it next Thursday, and then again next week.</p>
