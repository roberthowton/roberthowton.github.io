&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Hylomorphism&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The metaphysical theory that a &lt;strong&gt;substance&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;composite&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;form&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;morphē&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;eidos&lt;/em&gt;) and &amp;ldquo;matter&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;hulē&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parsing-the-definition&#34;&gt;Parsing the definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hylomorphism posits a relationship between three items: &lt;strong&gt;substance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;form&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;matter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;substance--ousia&#34;&gt;Substance (&lt;em&gt;ousia&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comes from the from the Greek &amp;ldquo;to be&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;einai&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Aristotle, has a variety of meanings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Property&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;that which is one&amp;rsquo;s own&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;existence&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;to on&lt;/em&gt;) - Charles Kahn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both senses seem to be at work in Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s conception of substance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1--substance-as-essence&#34;&gt;(1) Substance as essence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Aristotle, the &lt;em&gt;ousia&lt;/em&gt; of a thing is identical to &amp;ldquo;what it is&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;ti esti&lt;/em&gt;) or, as it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes known, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;essence&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;what it is&amp;rdquo; corresponds to a thing&amp;rsquo;s definition (&lt;em&gt;horos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;horismos&lt;/em&gt;, lit. &amp;ldquo;limits&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;boundaries&amp;rdquo;), or what we know when we know what something is, it&amp;rsquo;s essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association between &lt;em&gt;ousia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ti esti&lt;/em&gt;, and definition precedes Aristotle. Recall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socrates&lt;/strong&gt; (in the Platonic dialogues at least) famously traces disputes about the status of some action as virtuous, or the properties of a given virtue, to questions about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; that virtue &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plato, &lt;em&gt;Meno&lt;/em&gt; 70a&amp;ndash;b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MENO: Can you tell me, Socrates, can virtue be taught? Or is it not
teachable but the result of practice, or is it neither of these, but men possess
it by nature or in some other way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOCRATES: &amp;hellip;I myself, Meno, am as poor as my fellow citizens in this matter, and I
blame myself for my complete ignorance about virtue. If I do not know
what something is, how could I know what qualities it possesses? Or do
you think that someone who does not know at all who Meno is could
know whether he is good-looking or rich or well-born, or the opposite of
these? Do you think that is possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plato&lt;/strong&gt; famously follows Socrates in thinking of the objects of knowledge as corresponding to the &amp;ldquo;what it is&amp;rdquo;, or essence, of what we know&amp;mdash;with one major difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plato, &lt;em&gt;Phaedo&lt;/em&gt; 70b&amp;ndash;c&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then before we began to see or hear or otherwise perceive, we must
have possessed knowledge of the Equal itself if we were about to refer
our sense perceptions of equal objects to it, and realized that all of them
were eager to be like it, but were inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That follows from what has been said, Socrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we began to see and hear and otherwise perceive right after birth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must then have acquired the knowledge of the Equal before this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems then that we must have possessed it before birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if we had this knowledge, we knew before birth and immedi-
ately after not only the Equal, but the Greater and the Smaller and all such
things, for our present argument is no more about the Equal than about
d the Beautiful itself, the Good itself, the Just, the Pious and, as I say, about
all those things which we mark with the seal of &amp;ldquo;what it is,&amp;rdquo; both when
we are putting questions and answering them. So we must have acquired
knowledge of them all before we were born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how Aristotle characterizes the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aristotle, &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; A 6, 987a28&amp;ndash;b12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the systems we have named came the philosophy of
Plato, which in most respects followed these thinkers, but had
peculiarities that distinguished it [30] from the philosophy of
the Italians. For, having in his youth first become familiar
with Cratylus and with the Heraclitean doctrines (that all
sensible things are ever in a state of flux and there is no
knowledge about them), these views he held even in later
years. Socrates, however, was busying himself about ethical
matters and [987b1] neglecting the world of nature as a whole
but seeking the universal in these ethical matters, and fixed
thought for the first time on definitions; Plato accepted his
teaching, but held that the problem applied not to any sensible
thing but to entities [5] of another kind—for this reason, that
the common definition could not be a definition of any
sensible thing, as they were always changing. Things of this
other sort, then, he called Ideas, and sensible things, he said,
were apart from these, and were all called after these; for the
multitude of things which have the same name as the Form
exist by participation in it. Only the name ‘participation’ was
new; for the [10] Pythagoreans say that things exist by
imitation of numbers, and Plato says they exist by
participation, changing the name. But what the participation
or the imitation of the Forms could be they left an open
question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2--substance-as-what-is&#34;&gt;(2) Substance as &amp;ldquo;what is&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;to on&lt;/em&gt; in Presocratic thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s testimony alludes to a distinction that occupied Plato as well as Presocrates like Parmenides, Melissus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus: the distinction between &amp;ldquo;what is&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;to on&lt;/em&gt;) and &amp;ldquo;what is not&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;to mē on&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmenides and his Eleatic &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; famously challenged the possibility of change (or &amp;ldquo;coming to be&amp;rdquo;) on the grounds that it is impossible for there to be anything except &lt;em&gt;to on&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick &amp;amp; dirty version of the Eleatic argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmenides: not only is it impossible for &lt;em&gt;to mē on&lt;/em&gt; to be, it is impossible to think or even say &lt;em&gt;to mē on&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If what-is &amp;ldquo;came to be&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;ginesthai&lt;/em&gt;), it previously was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, what-is did not come to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, coming to be (change) is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontological theories of the so-called Eleatic pluralists&amp;mdash;Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus&amp;mdash;are often read as attempts to explain change in a way consistent with Eleatic principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empedocles&lt;/strong&gt; argued that what-is (the four elements) exists in an eternal cycle of combination and separation governed by the causal principles Love and Strife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anaxagoras&lt;/strong&gt; argued that &amp;ldquo;all is in all&amp;rdquo;, and that the macroscopic differences in things are brought about by alternating shifts in the preponderance of some properties over others in different portions of the cosmic mixture, the changes being brought about and ordered by &lt;em&gt;Nous&lt;/em&gt; (mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democritus&lt;/strong&gt; (and Leucippus) argued that &lt;em&gt;to on&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;to mē on&lt;/em&gt; both equally are: &lt;em&gt;to on&lt;/em&gt; are indivisible (atomic) bodies, &lt;em&gt;to mē on&lt;/em&gt; is the void through which they travel, combine, and separate with one another. Macroscopic change is just the combination and separation of unchanging microscopic atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;to on&lt;/em&gt; in Plato&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plato picks up on this distinction, dividing the objects of cognition between coming-to-be (&lt;em&gt;genesis&lt;/em&gt;), which we apprehend by means of the senses, and what is (&lt;em&gt;ousia&lt;/em&gt;), which we apprehend by thought. (&lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt; 7, 534a)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, Plato seems to have &lt;em&gt;ontologically&lt;/em&gt; separated the objects of perception and the objects of thought, and reserved the designation &amp;ldquo;real being&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;to ontōs on&lt;/em&gt;) for the objects of thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plato, &lt;em&gt;Timaeus&lt;/em&gt; 52a&amp;ndash;b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own
form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not
destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere
else, nor itself enters into anything else anywhere, is one thing. It is invisi-
ble&amp;mdash;it cannot be perceived by the senses at all&amp;mdash;and it is the role of
understanding to study it. The second thing is that which shares the other&amp;rsquo;s
name and resembles it. This thing can be perceived by the senses, and it
has been begotten. It is constantly borne along, now coming to be in a
certain place and then perishing out of it. It is apprehended by opinion,
which involves sense perception. And the third type is space, which exists
always and cannot be destroyed. It provides afixed state for all things
that come to be. It is itself apprehended by a kind of bastard reasoning
that does not involve sense perception, and it is hardly even an object of
conviction. We look at it as in a dream when we say that everything that
exists must of necessity be somewhere, in some place and occupying some
space, and that that which doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist somewhere, whether on earth or
in heaven, doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distinction is a central component of Plato&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Theory of Forms&amp;rdquo;, so called because he reserved the word &lt;em&gt;eidos&lt;/em&gt;, form, for the real beings apprehended solely by thought&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;aristotle-on-substance&#34;&gt;Aristotle on substance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What is a &lt;em&gt;substance&lt;/em&gt; in Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s theory?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Answer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Depends on where you look!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Substance is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the strictest sense, what is &amp;ldquo;neither said of nor present in a subject&amp;rdquo; (2a11&amp;ndash;13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A certain this&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;tode ti&lt;/em&gt;), i.e., something &amp;ldquo;indivisible&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;numerically one&amp;rdquo; (3b10&amp;ndash;11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphysics Z:&lt;/strong&gt; The substance &lt;em&gt;of a thing&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. some &lt;em&gt;tode ti&lt;/em&gt;) could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;universal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  subject of predication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;cause of being&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; 17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation:&lt;/strong&gt; Matter and form play a significant role of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s discussion of substance in &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z, but &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Categories&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt; How do the &lt;em&gt;Categories&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z accounts of substance relate? Do Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s views on substance develop? If so, how does the introduction of hylomorphism influence the development of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s views?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;form--morphē-eidos&#34;&gt;Form (&lt;em&gt;morphē&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;eidos&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle has two words for form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eidos&lt;/em&gt; (lit., &amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo;), which comes from the (related) Greek words &amp;ldquo;to see&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;oida&lt;/em&gt;) and &amp;ldquo;to know&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;eidenai&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morphē&lt;/em&gt;,  which means &amp;ldquo;shape&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;appearance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is distinctive about Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s conception of form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards an answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall what Aristotle says of Plato&amp;rsquo;s reception of Socrates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates was the first to draw attention to definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plato, however, was convinced that the sensible world was in a state of constant flux and change, which meant that what definitions &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; could not be anything sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the objects of definition must be &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; from the mutable objects of perception and, unlike them, imperceptible, stable, unchanging, fully what they are, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle famously &lt;em&gt;denies&lt;/em&gt; that that forms are separable in the way Plato claimed (see &lt;em&gt;On Ideas&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that forms are separable from sensible &amp;ldquo;particulars&amp;rdquo; implies that forms could be &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; sensibles (&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Δ 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the contrary, Aristotle believes that &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; would be without &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; substances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aristotle, &lt;em&gt;Categories&lt;/em&gt; 5, 2a35&amp;ndash;b5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other things are either said of the primary substances
as subjects or in [35] them as subjects. This is clear from an
examination of cases. For example, animal is predicated of
man and therefore also of the individual man; for were it
predicated of none of the individual men it would not be
predicated of man at all. Again, colour is [2b1] in body and
therefore also in an individual body; for were it not in some
individual body it would not be in body at all. Thus all the
other things are either said of the primary substances as
subjects or in them as subjects. So if the primary substances
[5] did not exist it would be impossible for any of the other
things to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;aside--little-p--platonic-vs-dot--little-a--aristotelian-theories-of-universals&#34;&gt;Aside:  (little &amp;ldquo;p&amp;rdquo;) platonic vs. (little &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;) aristotelian theories of universals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Universal&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;said of&amp;rdquo; many things, e.g. redness, &amp;ldquo;human being&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Particular&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;said of&amp;rdquo; many things, e.g. scarlet, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; scarlet letter, Socrates&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Would &lt;em&gt;scarlet&lt;/em&gt; exist if nothing were scarlet colored?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Little &amp;ldquo;p&amp;rdquo;) platonic response:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! Universals are not ontologically dependent on their particular instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Little &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;) aristotelian response:&lt;/strong&gt; No! Universals depend on their particular instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;controversies-over-aristotle-s-theory-of-form&#34;&gt;Controversies over Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s theory of form&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are Aristotelian forms &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If form corresponds to the &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of a thing, is it also the &lt;em&gt;substance&lt;/em&gt; of that thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is form always the form of some &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;matter--hulē&#34;&gt;Matter (&lt;em&gt;hulē&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally means &amp;ldquo;wood&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;stick&amp;rdquo;, but Aristotle associates it with two features of particulars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;subject&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;substratum&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;hupokeimenon&lt;/em&gt;) of which properties are predicated. (Aristotle associates substance with this too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That from which&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;to ex hou&lt;/em&gt;): most intuitively, the materials from which an object (Socrates or a chair) is fashioned or comes to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle associates matter (or the &amp;ldquo;material cause&amp;rdquo;) with the theories of the earlier Ionian &amp;ldquo;natural philosophers&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;phusiologoi&lt;/em&gt;): Thales (everything is [from] water), Anaximander (everything is from the &amp;ldquo;unlimited&amp;rdquo;, &lt;em&gt;apeiron&lt;/em&gt;), Anaximenes (everything is [from] air):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aristotle, &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; A 3, 983b5&amp;ndash;19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the first philosophers, most thought the principles which
were of the nature of matter were the only principles of all things;
that of which all things that are consist, and from which they first
come to be, and into which they are finally [10] resolved (the
substance remaining, but changing in its modifications), this
they say is the element and the principle of things, and
therefore they think nothing is either generated or destroyed,
since this sort of entity is always conserved, as we say
Socrates neither comes to be absolutely when he comes to be
beautiful or musical, [15] nor ceases to be when he loses these
characteristics, because the substratum, Socrates himself,
remains. So they say nothing else comes to be or ceases to be;
for there must be some entity—either one or more than
one—from which all other things come to be, it being
conserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No clear Socratic or Platonic precedent&amp;mdash;although compare Plato&amp;rsquo;s notion of &amp;ldquo;space&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;chōrē&lt;/em&gt;) in &lt;em&gt;Timaeus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle often speaks of matter as a relative term: all matter is the matter &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter of the chair is wood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter of the wood is earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the matter of the chair is not earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;matter is the &lt;strong&gt;potential&lt;/strong&gt; for form, which, in turn, is that &lt;strong&gt;actualization&lt;/strong&gt; of some material potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions-for-unit-1&#34;&gt;Questions for Unit 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Aristotle understand &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;substance&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Organon&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a framework within which we can make senses of a &lt;em&gt;hylomorphic&lt;/em&gt; analysis of substance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cat.&lt;/em&gt; 5, 2a11&amp;ndash;19 (Ackrill tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A substance—that which is called a substance most
strictly, primarily, and most of all—is that which is neither
said of a subject nor in a subject, e.g. the [15] individual man
or the individual horse. The species in which the things
primarily called substances are, are called secondary
substances, as also are the genera of these species. For
example, the individual man belongs in a species, man, and
animal is a genus of the species; so these—both man and
animal—are called secondary substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;characteristics-of-substance-in-cat-dot-5&#34;&gt;Characteristics of substance in &lt;em&gt;Cat.&lt;/em&gt; 5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substance is not present in anything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary substances&lt;/strong&gt; are neither said of nor present in anything else as subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary substances&lt;/strong&gt; are said of primary substances, but present in nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differentia&lt;/strong&gt; too are not present in anything as subject, but they are neither primary nor secondary substances&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; How then do differentia fit into the &lt;em&gt;Cat.&lt;/em&gt; 2 division of beings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything called from them are so-called synonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No contrary of substance&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;contraries&lt;/strong&gt; iff ∀x(Fx→¬Gx) ∀x(Gx→¬Fx)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;contradictories&lt;/strong&gt; iff ∀x[(¬Fx→Gx) &amp;amp; (¬Gx→Fx)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substances do not admit of a more and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most distinctive&amp;rdquo;: substances are (1) numerically one but (2) capable of receiving contraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat. 5, 4a10&amp;ndash;21 (Ackrill tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems most distinctive of substance that what is
numerically one and the [10] same is able to receive
contraries. In no other case could one bring forward anything,
numerically one, which is able to receive contraries. For
example, a colour which is numerically one and the same will
not be black and white, nor will numerically one and the same
action be bad and good; and similarly with everything [15]
else that is not substance. A substance, however, numerically
one and the same, is able to receive contraries. For example,
an individual man—one and the same—becomes pale at one
time and dark at another, and hot and cold, and bad and [20]
good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;term&lt;/strong&gt; (A, B, C, &amp;hellip;) is what is predicated and what it is predicated of in a &lt;strong&gt;premise&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;premise&lt;/strong&gt; is a sentence that affirms or denies one &lt;strong&gt;term&lt;/strong&gt; of another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirmation:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;A belongs to B&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premises are distinguished by &lt;strong&gt;quantity&lt;/strong&gt; (and &lt;strong&gt;quality&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. necessity, possibility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;A belongs to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; belong to some B&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;syllogism&lt;/strong&gt; is &amp;ldquo;a &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; in which, certain things being posited (i.e., the premises), something else (i.e., the conclusion) results by necessity because these things are so&amp;rdquo; (24b18&amp;ndash;20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s syllogistic is the formal study of what combinations of premises produce syllogisms, using three tools:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three &lt;strong&gt;rules of conversion&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;APr.&lt;/em&gt; 1.2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AeB → BeA:&lt;/strong&gt; If A belongs to no B, B belongs to no A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AiB → BiA:&lt;/strong&gt; If A belongs to some B, B belongs to some A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AaB → BiA:&lt;/strong&gt; If A belongs to all B, B belongs to some A.
(Note: Aristotle assumes terms are non-empty!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments from impossibility (&lt;em&gt;reductio ad absurdum&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I call a syllogism perfect if it requires nothing beyond the things posited for the necessity to be evident.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Aristotle, syllogisms of the First Figure are all perfect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Barbara&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Celarent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;AeB, BaC \vdash AeC&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syllogisms in the second and third figures proved by conversion and reduction to one of the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; first figure syllogisms; figures differ according to where the &lt;strong&gt;middle term&lt;/strong&gt; (the term that appears in both premises) appears in each premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;syllogistic-and-explanation&#34;&gt;Syllogistic and Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Demonstration&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A &amp;ldquo;knowledge-yielding&amp;rdquo; syllogism; a syllogism grasp of which imparts scientific knowledge (&lt;em&gt;epistēmē&lt;/em&gt;) of the conclusion.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Posterior Analytics&lt;/em&gt; 1.2, 71b9-12 (Barnes tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think we understand (= know scientifically) a thing &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt;
(and not in the sophistic fashion accidentally) whenever we think
we are aware both that the explanation [10] because of which the
object is is its explanation, and that it is not possible for this
to be otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syllogistic is a necessary preliminary to the study of demonstration and demonstrative scientific knowledge &amp;ldquo;because syllogism is more universal than demonstration, for a demonstration is a kind of syllogism, but not every syllogism is a demonstration&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;APr.&lt;/em&gt; 1.4, 28&amp;ndash;31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the universal patterns of which demonstrations are special instances, Aristotle thinks the syllogistic implies a method for inquiry and explanation in all disciplines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prior Analytics&lt;/em&gt; 1.30, 46a3&amp;ndash;10 (Striker tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the method is the same for all subjects, in philosophy as well as
in the technical or mathematical disciplines. For one must discern for
both terms what belongs to them and what they belong to, and be
supplied with as many of those terms as possible. One must examine
them with respect to the three terms, in one way when refuting, in
another way when establishing something; and when it is a question
of truth, from the terms that are listed as belonging truly, for dialecti-
cal syllogisms from premisses according to opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method presupposes the classification of beings similar to the one articulated in the &lt;em&gt;Categories&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prior Analytics&lt;/em&gt; 1.27, 43a25&amp;ndash;43&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of all the things there are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some are such that they cannot be predicated truly and universally of anything else (for instance, Cleon or Callias, that is, what is individual and perceptible), but other things may be predicated of them (for each of these is both a man and an animal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things are themselves predicated of others , but nothing else is prior and predicated of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some things are both predicated themselves of others and others of them, as man is predicated of Callias and animal of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That [1] some things are by nature such as to be said of nothing else is clear, for just about every perceptible thing is such as not to be predicated of anything except accidentally&amp;mdash;for we do sometimes say that the white thing there is Socrates, or that what is approaching is Callias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But [2] that one also comes to a halt if one goes upwards,  we will explain later; for the moment let this be assumed. (&lt;em&gt;APo.&lt;/em&gt; 1.3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with respect to those things one cannot demonstrate that something else is predicated of them (except perhaps as a matter of mere opinion), but only that they themselves are predicated of other things;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nor can one demonstrate that individuals are said of other things, but only that other things are said of them. But clearly the intermediate things admit of both, for they themselves will be said of others and others of them. And by and large arguments and investigations are mostly concerned with these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What of [3], the terms that are both predicated and predicated of? Aristotle continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prior Analytics&lt;/em&gt; 1.28 43b1&amp;ndash;11 (Striker tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one must select the premisses about each thing in the following
way: &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt;, set down the thing itself, its definitions, and whatever
properties are peculiar to it; &lt;strong&gt;after that&lt;/strong&gt;, whatever follows this thing,
what is followed by it, and whatever cannot belong to the thing. (One
need not select the terms to which the thing itself cannot belong, since
the privative premiss converts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the terms that follow one must also distinguish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those that are predicated in the definition,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those that are peculiar properties,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and those that are predicated as accidents; and among those, which sort is predicated only as a matter of opinion and which according to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the more such terms one has available, the faster one will hit upon a conclusion, and the more these belong in truth, the more one will hit upon a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Which of 1&amp;ndash;3 are said-of predications, and which are present-in predications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--listend--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a ready supply of terms, Aristotle argues (&lt;em&gt;APr.&lt;/em&gt; 1.28) we can construct each kind of proposition (&lt;em&gt;pons asinorum&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;


















&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary by Gisela Striker (2009, 195&amp;ndash;6):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, instead of building a helpful bridge, the diagram seems
to make Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s rules look much more complicated than they
are, because it also shows the cases in which no syllogisms can be
found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle first introduces the letters B , C, D and F, G, H to stand
for sets of terms, while A and E stand for the predicate- and subject­
terms of the desired conclusion. For both A and E there will be lists of
terms that either &#39; follow&#39; them ( B and F ) or are followed by the m (C
and G), or that cannot be predicated of them (D and H). Evidently, the
terms that are said to follow a given term are universally predicable
of it. The middle term in each case will be one that occurs in one of
the lists for A as well as one of the lists for E. In the first example,
Aristotle makes this explicit by speaking of &amp;lsquo;one of the Cs&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;one
of the Fs&amp;rsquo;; later on he simply uses the letters to stand for an item on
the respective list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontology Aristotle presents in &lt;em&gt;Categories&lt;/em&gt; is complemented elsewhere in the &lt;em&gt;Organon&lt;/em&gt; with a sophisticated methodology for understanding and explaining beings and their attributes. (Most notably in the &lt;em&gt;Analytics&lt;/em&gt;, but also in the &lt;em&gt;Topics&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspicuously &lt;em&gt;absent&lt;/em&gt; from this ontology and explanatory theory is a method for understanding and explaining &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;, including both changes in the attributes belonging to substances and the coming to be of substances themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(N.B., considerations of change and coming to be are not wholly absent: see especially &lt;em&gt;APo.&lt;/em&gt; 2.12.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the &lt;em&gt;Organon&lt;/em&gt;, Aristotle will attempt to adapt this method and theory of explanation to accommodate explaining coming-to-be, but before he can do this, he has first to make conceptual sense of the phenomenon of change &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-dot-1-a-puzzle-about-coming-to-be&#34;&gt;2.1 | A Puzzle About Coming to Be&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics 1.1, 185a13&amp;ndash;20 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, on the other hand, must take for granted that the things
that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in
motion—which is indeed made plain by induction. Moreover,
no one is bound to solve every kind of difficulty that may be
[15] raised, but only as many as are drawn falsely from the
principles of the science: it is not our business to refute those
that do not arise in this way; just as it is the duty of the
geometer to refute the squaring of the circle by means of
segments, but it is not his duty to refute Antiphon’s proof. At
the same time the holders of the theory of which we are
speaking do incidentally raise physical questions, though
nature is not their subject; so it will perhaps be as well to
spend a few words on them, especially as [20] the inquiry is
not without scientific interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; I is devote to the subject of &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;archai&lt;/em&gt; pl., &lt;em&gt;archē&lt;/em&gt;) of natural science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmenides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[F8 ] . . . Only one tale is left of the way:
that it is; and on this are posted
very many signs, that [i] what-is is ungenerated and imperishable,
[ii] a whole of one kind, [iii] unperturbed and [iv] complete.
[i] Never was it, nor shall it be, since it now is, all together,
one, continuous. For what birth would you seek of it?
Where [or: how] , whence did it grow? Not from what-is-not will I
allow
you to say or to think; for it is not sayable or thinkable
that it is not. And what need would have stirred it
later or earlier, starting from nothing, to grow?
Thus it must be completely or not at all.
Nor ever from what-is-not will the strength of faith allow
anything to come to be beside it. Wherefore neither to come to be
nor to perish did Justice permit it by loosening its shackles,
but she holds it fast. And the decision concerning these things
comes to this:
it is or it is not. Thus the decision is made, as is necessary,
to leave the one way unthought, unnamed - for it is not a true
way - the other to be and to be true.
And how would what-is be hereafter? How would it have come
to be?
For if it has come to be, it is not, and similarly if it is ever about
ro k
Thus coming to be is quenched and perishing unheard of.
[ii] Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike,
nor is there any more here, which would keep it from holding
together,
nor any less, but it is all full of what-is.
Thus it is all continuous, for what-is cleaves to what-is.
[iii] Further, motionless in the limits of great bonds
it is without starting and stopping, since coming to be and
perishing
wandered very far away, and true faith banished them.
Remaining the same in the same by itself it lies
and thus it remains steadfast there; for mighty Necessity
holds it in the bonds of a limit, which confines it round about.
[iv] Wherefore it is not right for what-is to be incomplete;
for it is not needy; if it were&#39; it would lack everything.
The same thing is for thinking and is wherefore there is thought.
For not without what-is, to which it is directed,
will you find thought. For nothing else &amp;lt; either&amp;gt; i s nor shall be
beside what-is, since Fate shackled it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What-is (the principle) is one, and motionless, but &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One: the cosmos is in an eternal cycle of combination and separation, governed by the contrary principles Love and Strife&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many: everything comes about from the combination and separation of the four &amp;ldquo;roots&amp;rdquo;, earth, air, fire, and water, by Love and Strife&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[F20] I shall speak a double tale: at one time they grew to be one alone
from many, at another time it grew apart to be many from one.
Double is the birth of mortal things, and double the demise;
for the confluence of all things begets and destroys the one [generation] ,
while the other in turn, having been nurtured while things were
growing apart, fled away.
And these things never cease continually alternating,
at one time all coming together into one by Love,
at another time each being borne apart by the enmity of Strife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;anaxagoras&#34;&gt;Anaxagoras&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[F15] Everything else has a portion of everything, but mind is boundless,
autonomous, and mixed with no object, but it is alone all by itself. If it were
not by itself, but had been mixed with something else, it would have a portion
of all objects, if it had been mixed with any; for there is a portion of everything
in everything, as I said earlier [F12]. And the things mixed with it would hinder
it from ruling any object in the way it does when it is alone by itself. For it
is the finest of all objects and the purest, and it exercises complete oversight
over everything and prevails above all. And all things that have soul, both the
larger and the smaller, these does mind rule. And of the whole revolution did
mind take control, so that it revolved in the beginning. And first it began from
a small revolution, now it is revolving more, and it will revolve still more. And
things mixed together, things separated, and things segregated, all these did
mind comprehend. And the kinds of things that were to be - such as were but
now are not, all that now are, and such as will be - all these did mind set in
order, as well as this revolution, with which the stars, the sun, the moon, the
air, and the aether which were being separated now revolve. For this revolution
made things separate. And from the rare is separated the dense, from the cold
the hot, from the dark the bright, and from the wet the dry. But there are many
portions of many things. And nothing is completely separated nor segregated
the one from the other except mind. Mind is all alike, both the larger and the
smaller. No other thing is like anything else, but each one is and was most
manifestly those things of which it has the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming-to-be is always between &lt;em&gt;contraries&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the number of the principles cannot be one, since there is no contrary to one&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the principles are either two or three, &amp;ldquo;but whether two or three is a question of considerable difficulty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Non-musical Socrates becomes musical Socrates&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Pass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (1) and (2), both &amp;ldquo;that which becomes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;what it becomes&amp;rdquo; are &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (3), both &amp;ldquo;that which becomes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;what it becomes&amp;rdquo; are &lt;strong&gt;complex&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;combined&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sunkeitai&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple cases, in detail:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7, 190a9&amp;ndash;13 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a simple thing is said to become something, in one case it survives [10] through the process, in the other it does not. For the man remains a man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas what is not musical or is unmusical does not survive, either simply or combined with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In which simple case of coming-to-be does &amp;ldquo;that which becomes&amp;rdquo; survive (lit., &amp;ldquo;remain, persist&amp;rdquo;; &lt;em&gt;hupomenon&lt;/em&gt;)?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer:
-   &lt;strong&gt;Socrates&lt;/strong&gt; survives coming to be musical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   **The Non-Musical** does not survive coming to be musical.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;two-conditions-on-coming-to-be&#34;&gt;Two Conditions on Coming to Be&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7, 190a13&amp;ndash;21 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various cases of becoming in the way we are describing that there must always be an underlying [15] something, namely that which becomes, and that this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one. (By ‘in form’ I mean the same as ‘in account’.)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part survives, the other does not: what is not an opposite survives (for the man survives), but [20] not-musical or unmusical does not survive, nor does the compound of the two, namely the unmusical man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Subject Condition (SC)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In every case of coming to be, there must be some underlying subject, &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, such that it is true &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; comes to be&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Persistance Condition (PC)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In every case of coming to be, the underlying subject must remain &lt;strong&gt;one in number&lt;/strong&gt;, although not &lt;strong&gt;one in form&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;logos&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cf. Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s account of numerical unity in &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Δ:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Δ 6, 1017a30&amp;ndash;34 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, some things are one in number, others in species,
others in genus, others by analogy; in number those whose
matter is one, in species [= form] those whose formula is one, in genus
those to which the same figure of predication applies, by
analogy those which are related as a third thing is to a fourth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;varieties-of-coming-to-be&#34;&gt;Varieties of Coming to Be&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are said to come to be in different ways. In some cases we do not use the expression ‘come to be’, but ‘come to be so-and-so’. Only substances are said to come to be without qualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Qualified Coming to Be&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; comes to be &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; (for some predicable &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; in a non-substance category)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Unqualified Coming to Be&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; comes to be (or: &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; comes to be &lt;em&gt;an F&lt;/em&gt;, for some kind of substance &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;applying-sc-and-pc&#34;&gt;Applying SC and PC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject Condition applies to both qualified and unqualified coming to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7, 190a33&amp;ndash;b5 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in all cases other than substance it is plain that there must be something underlying, namely, that which becomes. For when a thing comes to be of such a quantity or quality or in such a relation, time, or place, a subject is always [35] presupposed, since substance alone is not predicated of another subject, but everything else of substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that substances too, and anything that can be said to be without [190 b 1] qualification, come to be from some underlying thing, will appear on examination. For we find in every case something that underlies from which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals and plants from seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What about PC?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualified Coming to Be:&lt;/strong&gt; Of course! It is the substance, or &lt;em&gt;tode ti&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7, 190b24&amp;ndash;28 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the subject is one numerically, though it is two in form. (For there is the man, the gold—in general, the countable &lt;strong&gt;matter&lt;/strong&gt;; for it is more of the nature of a [25] ‘this’, and what comes to be does not come from it accidentally; the privation, on the other hand, and the contrariety are accidental.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Unqualified Coming to Be&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The &amp;ldquo;matter&amp;rdquo; of substance/subject of unqualified coming to be is knowable on analogy to the matter of qualified comings to be:&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7, 191a9&amp;ndash;12 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying nature can be known by analogy. For as the bronze is to the [10] statue, the wood to the bed, or the matter and the formless before receiving form to any thing which has form, so is the underlying nature to substance, i.e. the ‘this’ or existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial formulation of &lt;strong&gt;matter&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.9, 192a31&amp;ndash;33 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be, and which persists in the result, not accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;resolution-to-the-puzzle&#34;&gt;Resolution to the Puzzle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All coming to be is complex in that which comes to be:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7, 190b11&amp;ndash;15 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is always complex. There is, on the one hand, something which comes to be, and again something which becomes that—the latter in two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the opposite I mean the unmusical, by the subject, man; and similarly I call the absence of shape or form or order the opposite, and the bronze or stone or gold the [15] subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes to be is the &lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;morphē&lt;/em&gt;), e.g. Musical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes to be is always a &amp;ldquo;compound&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;suntheton&lt;/em&gt;) involving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Subject&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;hupokeimenon&lt;/em&gt;), e.g. Socrates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Opposite&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Privation&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g. Non-Musical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, there are (depending on how one describes the coming to be) either two or three principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7, 190b29&amp;ndash;191a2 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the contraries are the [30] principles—say for example the musical and the unmusical, the hot and the cold, the tuned and the untuned—and a sense in which they are not, since it is impossible for the contraries to be acted on by each other. But this difficulty also is solved by the fact that what underlies is different from the contraries; for it is itself not a [35] contrary. The principles therefore are, in a way, not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two; nor yet precisely two, since there is a difference of [191 a 1] being, but three. For to be man is different from to be unmusical, and to be unformed from to be bronze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Aim of the chapter&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;to show that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; this analysis of coming to be can solve &amp;ldquo;the difficulty of the early thinkers, as well as our own&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-dilemmatic-argument&#34;&gt;A Dilemmatic Argument&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.8, 191a25&amp;ndash;31 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of those who studied philosophy &amp;hellip; say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what is cannot come to be [30] (because it is already), and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must be underlying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; comes to be, it must come to be either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from what is, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from what is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; cannot come to be from what is, since what-is already &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; cannot come to be from what-is-not, since something must be underlying (SC, no generation &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Therefore&lt;/em&gt;, it is not the case that &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; comes to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-aristotelian-intervention&#34;&gt;The Aristotelian Intervention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinguish (1) coming to be from what is not &lt;em&gt;without qualification&lt;/em&gt; (which is impossible) from (2) coming to be from what is &lt;em&gt;not-F&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is incidental to what something comes to be from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor, but qua housebuilder, and turns gray, not qua [5] doctor, but qua dark-haired. On the other hand he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we are using words most appropriately when we say that a doctor does something or undergoes something, or becomes something from being a doctor, if he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor. Clearly then also to come to be so-and-so from what is not means ‘qua what is not’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Qua&lt;/em&gt; Operator&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; does φ &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;qua F&lt;/span&gt; iff &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; does φ &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s capacity as (an) F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disarming the Second Horn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall: that which comes to be is complex, including both &lt;strong&gt;subject&lt;/strong&gt; (which survives as a constituent of that which comes to be) and &lt;strong&gt;privation&lt;/strong&gt; (which is something which is not and does not survive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.8, 191b13&amp;ndash;17 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless we maintain that a thing may come to be from what is not in a qualified sense, i.e. accidentally. For a [15] thing comes to be from the privation, which in its own nature is something which is not—this not surviving as a constituent of the result. Yet this causes surprise, and it is thought impossible that something should come to be in the way described from what is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disarming the First Horn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall: the subject in every case comes to be &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; from being &lt;em&gt;not-F&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.8, 191b17&amp;ndash;25 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from what is, and that what is does not come to be except accidentally. In that way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus, suppose a dog to come to be from a dog, or a horse [20] from a horse. The dog would then, it is true, come to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a certain kind) but not as animal, for that is already there. But if anything is to become an animal, not accidentally, it will not be from animal; and if what is, not from what is—nor from what is not either, for it has been explained that [25] by ‘from what is not’ we mean qua what is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Details of Unqualified Coming to Be&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What is the subject of substantial generation? What is the relevant privation? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it the case that substances lacks contraries (&lt;em&gt;Cat.&lt;/em&gt; 5)?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A Puzzling Reference&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A. claims that the same dilemma has been solved elsewhere in terms of &lt;strong&gt;potentiality&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;dunamis&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;actuality&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;energeia&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Where, and how?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.8, 191b27&amp;ndash;29 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then is one way of solving the difficulty. Another consists in pointing out that the same things can be spoken of in terms of potentiality and actuality. But this has been done with greater precision elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Sublunary Aristotelian Simple Bodies (≈ Elements)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Earth, Air, Fire, Water&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Primary Differentia of Simple Bodies&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Hot and Cold, Wet and Dry
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire:&lt;/strong&gt; Hot + Dry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air:&lt;/strong&gt; Hot + Moist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water:&lt;/strong&gt; Cold + Moist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth:&lt;/strong&gt; Cold + Dry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Reciprocal Transformation of the Elements&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The coming to be of the elemental bodies is cyclical, effected by a replacement of a single pair of contraries between one element and the other.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air comes to be from Fire by the replacement of Dry with Moist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water comes to be from Air by the replacement of Cold with Hot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth comes to be from Water by the replacement of Moist with Dry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire comes to be from Earth by the replacement of Cold with Hot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;!--listend--&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Is elemental transformation possible without &lt;strong&gt;prime matter&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tasks-of-gc-1-dot-1-4&#34;&gt;The Tasks of &lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.1&amp;ndash;4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.1, 314a1&amp;ndash;5 (Williams tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our task now is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to pick out the causes and definitions of generation and corruption common to all those things which come to be and perish in the course of nature; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secondly to investigate growth and alteration, asking what each of them is, and whether we are to suppose that the nature of alteration and generation is the same or different, as they are certainly distinguished in name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.1&amp;ndash;3 are concerned principally with Task 1, specifically with articulating a basic account of unqualified generation and corruption&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GC 1.4&amp;ndash;5 are concerned principally with Task 2, distinguishing unqualified generation from both alteration and growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Task 2 so pressing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As A. tells us at the end of &lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.2 317a17&amp;ndash;26 (Williams tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, coming to be simpliciter, i.e. absolutely, is not defined by aggregation and segregation, as some say; nor is change in what is continuous the same as alteration. This is just where all the mistakes are made. Coming to be and ceasing to be simpliciter occur, not in virtue of aggregation and segregation, but when something changes from this to that as a whole. These people think that all such change is alteration, but there is in fact a distinction. &lt;strong&gt;For within the substratum there is something which corresponds to the definition and something which corresponds to the matter. When, therefore, the change takes place in these it will be generation or corruption: when it takes place in the affections, accidentally, it will be alteration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-basic-model-of-generation-in-gc-1-dot-1-3&#34;&gt;The Basic Model of Generation in &lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.1&amp;ndash;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers 2 questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is generation/corruption without qualification (or absolutely, or &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt;)? Why is it that some coming to be is absolute, while some is not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.3, 317b12&amp;ndash;34 (Williams tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemmas that arise concerning these matters and their solutions have been set out at greater length elsewhere, but it should now again be said by way of summary that in one way it is from what is not that a thing comes to be simpliciter, though in another way it is always from what is; for that which is potentially but is not actually must pre-exist, being described in both these ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even when these distinctions have been made, there remains a question of remarkable difficulty, which we must take up once again, namely, how is coming to be simpliciter possible, whether from what is potentially or some other way. One might well wonder whether there is coming to be of substance and the individual, as opposed to quality, quantity, and place (and the same question arises in the case of ceasing to be). For if something comes to be, clearly there will exist potentially, not actually, some substance from which the coming to be will arise and into which that which ceases to be has to change. Now will any of the others belong to this actually?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean is: Will that which is only potentially individual and existent, but neither individual nor existent simpliciter, have any quality or quanity or place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it has none of these, but all of them potentially, (a) that which in this sense is not will consequently be separable, and further, (b) the principal and perpetual fear of the early philosophers will be realized, namely, the coming to be of something from nothing previously existing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if being individual and a substance are not going to belong to it while some of the other things we have mentioned are, the affections will, as we have remarked, be separable from the substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is unqualified generation/corruption, why does it persist? Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the total quantity of bodies continually shrink into non-existence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.3, 318b33&amp;ndash;319a3 (Williams tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now stated the reason why there is such a thing as generation simpliciter, which is the corruption of something, and such a thing as corruption simpliciter, which is the generation of something: it is due to a difference of matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;either in respect of its being substance or not being substance,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or in respect of its being more or less so,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or because in the one case the matter from which or to which the change takes place is more perceptible and in the other case less perceptible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;How does this account of absolute generation apply to the transformation of the elements?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;distinguishing-absolute-generation-from-alteration--gc-1-dot-4&#34;&gt;Distinguishing Absolute Generation from Alteration (&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.4)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.4, 319b8&amp;ndash;21 (Williams tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substratum is one thing and the affection whose nature is to be predicated of the substratum another, and either of them can change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Alteration&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;So it is alteration when the substratum remains, being something perceptible [i.e., a &lt;em&gt;tode ti&lt;/em&gt; or individual] but change occurs in the affections which belong to it, whether these are contraries or intermediates. For example, the body is well then ill, but remains the same body; the bronze is now round, now a thing with corners, but remains the same [sc. bronze].&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Generation&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;When, however, the whole changes without anything perceptible remaining as the same substratum, but the way:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the seed changes entirely into blood,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water into air,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or air entirely into water,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then, when we have this sort of thing, it is a case of generation (and corrpution of something else); particularly if the change takes place from what is imperceptible to what is perceptible either by touch or by the other senses, as when water is generated or corrupts into air, since air is&amp;mdash;near enough&amp;mdash;imperceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases [sc. of generation] if some affection that is one of a pair of contraries remains the same in the thing generated as it was in the thing that has perished, e.g. when water comes from air, if both are transparent or &amp;lt;wet, but not&amp;gt; cold, this must not have the other, the terminus of the change, as an affection of itself. Otherwise it will be alteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-unqualified-nature-of-elemental-transformations&#34;&gt;The Unqualified Nature of Elemental Transformations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 1.4, 319b21&amp;ndash;31 (RFH rough tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ἐν δὲ τούτοις ἄν τι ὑπομένῃ πάθος τὸ αὐτὸ ἐναντιώ
σεως ἐν τῷ γενομένῳ καὶ τῷ φθαρέντι, οἷον ὅταν ἐξ ἀέρος
ὕδωρ, εἰ ἄμφω διαφανῆ ἢ ψυχρά, οὐ δεῖ τούτου θάτερον
πάθος εἶναι εἰς ὃ μεταβάλλει. Εἰ δὲ μή, ἔσται ἀλλοίωσις,
[25] οἷον ὁ μουσικὸς ἄνθρωπος ἐφθάρη, ἄνθρωπος δ&#39; ἄμουσος ἐγέ-
νετο, ὁ δ&#39; ἄνθρωπος ὑπομένει τὸ αὐτό.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Εἰ μὲν οὖν τούτου μὴ
πάθος ἦν καθ&#39; αὑτὸ ἡ μουσικὴ καὶ ἡ ἀμουσία, τοῦ μὲν γένε-
σις ἦν ἄν, τοῦ δὲ φθορά· διὸ ἀνθρώπου μὲν ταῦτα πάθη,
ἀνθρώπου δὲ μουσικοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπου ἀμούσου γένεσις καὶ
[30] φθορά· νῦν δὲ πάθος τοῦτο τοῦ ὑπομένοντος. Διὸ ἀλλοίωσις τὰ
τοιαῦτα.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I] In those things in which some affection from among a pair of contraries remains the same in both what comes to be and what is destroyed&amp;mdash;for instance, when water [comes to be] from air, assuming both are transparent or &lt;del&gt;cold&lt;/del&gt; [moist?]&amp;mdash;the other, into which it changes, must not be an affection of it. If it is, it will be [a case of] alteration, as [when] the musical person perishes and the unmusical person comes to be, the person remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[II] &lt;strong&gt;Hence if &lt;em&gt;musical&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unmusical&lt;/em&gt; were not &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; affections of this [sc. the person], we would have generation of the latter and passing away of the former.&lt;/strong&gt; This is why they are affections of a person, whereas of &lt;em&gt;musical person&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unmusical person&lt;/em&gt; we have generation and destruction. As it is, however, this is an affection of what remains, for which reason [transformations] of this sort are [cases of] alteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Upshot of [I]&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;On pain of being cases of alteration, it cannot be supposed that the persisting subject of elemental transformations is the quality that inheres in both what comes to be and what perishes.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Upshot of [II]&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Despite the superficial similarity in the locutions (1) &amp;ldquo;the musical person comes to be the unmusical person&amp;rdquo; and (2) &amp;ldquo;the hot moist comes to be the cold moist&amp;rdquo;, they describe two ontologically distinct changes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (1), the affections &lt;em&gt;musical&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unmusical&lt;/em&gt; are affections of the person &lt;em&gt;as such&lt;/em&gt;, which therefore persists through the alteration as subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (2), however, the affections &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; are affections of the moist only &lt;em&gt;incidentally&lt;/em&gt;, in the way the pale thing (the person who happens to be pale) is musical or unmusical. Hence it is wrong to suppose that the moist is a subject of predication, much less that it persists through the transition from hot to cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-interpretive-strategies--pros-and-cons&#34;&gt;Two Interpretive Strategies (Pros and Cons)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What, if anything, is the subject of which &lt;em&gt;moist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; are predicated?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First air, then water:&lt;/strong&gt; Coheres with A.&amp;rsquo;s denial of a persistent subject in unqualified generation, but at the cost of treating elemental transformation (and all substantial coming-to-be) as a process of &amp;ldquo;sheer replacement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Avoids the &amp;ldquo;sheer replacement&amp;rdquo; model, and perhaps enjoys some textual support, but the metaphysical victory is pyrrhic: what sort of improvement is it to say that water comes to be from pure potentiality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-dot-1-nature-and-causation&#34;&gt;3.1 | Nature &amp;amp; Causation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unity of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; is a matter of scholarly controversy, but it seems clear that &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2&amp;ndash;4 (at least) constitute a continuous discussion of &lt;strong&gt;nature&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;phusis&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2 provides the foundation of this discussion, defending a definition of nature as well as an enumeration of the kinds of cause operative in the things that come about by or in accordance with nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-division-among-beings&#34;&gt;A Division Among Beings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1 begins with a distinction among beings (&lt;em&gt;ta onta&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 192b8&amp;ndash;23 (RFH quasi-literal translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the things that are (&lt;em&gt;ta onta&lt;/em&gt;), some are by nature (&lt;em&gt;phusei&lt;/em&gt;), while others are due to other causes (&lt;em&gt;aitia&lt;/em&gt;). By nature are animals and their parts; plants; and simple bodies like earth, fire, air, and water (for we say that these and things like them are by nature); and all of these plainly differ from those things which are not constituted by nature. &lt;strong&gt;For each of these [which are constituted by nature] has in itself a principle (&lt;em&gt;archē&lt;/em&gt;) of change and rest, some [a principle of change] in respect of place, some in respect of growth and decay, and some in respect of alteration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a bed, or cloak, or anything else of that sort does not have an innate impulse for change, [at least] not &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; satisfying these descriptions and to the extent that they are products of craft (&lt;em&gt;technē&lt;/em&gt;). However, insofar as they are made of stone or earth, or a mixture of the two, to that extent they do [have an innate impulse for change], since &lt;strong&gt;nature is a kind of principle and cause of changing and resting in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not accidentally&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here Aristotle divides &lt;em&gt;ta onta&lt;/em&gt; (exhaustively?) into two kinds:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that are (what they are) by nature, which, as the sort of things they are, have an internal causal principle of change and rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that are (what they are) not by nature, which do not, as the sort of things they are, have an internal causal principle of change and rest, but come about from other causes (e.g., craft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nature-as-a-principle-of-change&#34;&gt;Nature as a Principle of Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes things that are by nature from things that are due to other causes (including craft) is the presence of a certain &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; cause and source of change and rest, which Aristotle identifies as &lt;strong&gt;nature&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Nature&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A causal source (principle) of change/rest internal to what it belongs to primarily &lt;em&gt;in virtue of itself (per se), i.e. not accidentally&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The qualification &lt;em&gt;in virtue of itself&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;non-accidentally&lt;/em&gt; refers to the connection between what is said to be &amp;ldquo;by nature&amp;rdquo; and what the nature in question is said to be predicated of:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 192b23&amp;ndash;32 (RFH quasi-literal translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean by &amp;ldquo;not accidentally&amp;rdquo; that, for instance, although a doctor might be a cause of health in himself, he nevertheless has skill in medicine not to the extent that he is healed; rather, the doctor just &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; to be the same as the person who is healed. Indeed, this is why the two [sc. doctor and patient] can be separated from one another. Circumstances are similar with each of the other things that have been made: none of them have the source of production in themselves. Rather, for some [the cause] is present in other things and comes from without, such as a house and other handmade products, while for others it is present in themselves but not in virtue of themselves&amp;mdash;whatever comes to be a cause of itself accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions-for-aristotle-s-definition&#34;&gt;Questions for Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s definition:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the order of explanation between the division of beings and the definition of nature? Do we take the division as given and posit the presence of nature to explain it, or is it the other way around? (Cf. 193a3 ff.: &amp;ldquo;That there is such as thing as nature would be ludicrous to try to show&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For A., nature is a &amp;ldquo;causal principle&amp;rdquo;, both an &lt;em&gt;archē&lt;/em&gt; and a cause (&lt;em&gt;aition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;aitia&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does nature (understood as an &lt;em&gt;archē&lt;/em&gt;) relate to the &lt;em&gt;archai&lt;/em&gt; of natural beings discussed in &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 293b18&amp;ndash;21 (RFH tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, both form and nature are double, since privation too is in a way form. But whether or not privation and opposition of a sort are concerned with unqualified generation, we will have to inquire later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does nature operate as a cause? (Cf. &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.3: cause is said in many ways&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nature-as-form-and-matter&#34;&gt;Nature as Form and Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One step toward answering these questions is to observe that, in &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, A. identifies nature with both &lt;em&gt;substance-&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;subjecthood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nature-as-substance-and-subject&#34;&gt;Nature as Substance and Subject&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 192b32&amp;ndash;34 (RFH quasi-literal translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature, then, is what we said, and everything that has such as principle has a nature. All of these, moreover, are substances (&lt;em&gt;ousiai&lt;/em&gt;), since each is a kind of subject (&lt;em&gt;hupokeimenon ti&lt;/em&gt;), and nature is always present in a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nature-as-matter&#34;&gt;Nature as Matter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all nature is present in a subject, and (as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen) matter is a subject, it is only natural to suppose that the nature of each thing corresponds to its &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 193a9&amp;ndash;17 (RFH rough trans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and substance of things in which nature is present seem to be that which exists primary in each, &lt;namely what is&gt; unformed in virtue of itself, [so that] for instance wood would be the nature of a bed and bronze of a statue. As a sign of this Antiphon says that if you bury a bed and the rotting wood acquired the capacity (&lt;em&gt;dunamis&lt;/em&gt;) to send up a shoot, what would come about would not be a bed but wood, which shows that what exists accidentally is the arrangment according to convention and craft [sc. the bed], but the substance is the other [sc. the wood], which also remains continuously and suffers these [changes in arrangement].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As A. makes clear, this line of reasoning terminates in the conclusion that the elements are the nature of things, for if wood is the nature of the bed, and wood stands (e.g.) to earth as the bed to the wood, then earth would be the nature of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 193a22&amp;ndash;28 (Charlton tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence fire, earth, air, and water have been held to be the nature of things, some people choosing just one for this role, some several, and some making use of all. Those who fix on some such element or elements represent it or them as the entire reality, and say that other things are merely affections, states, or dispositions; and these elements are all held to be imperishable in that they do not change out of themselves, whilst other things come to be and pass away as often as you please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nature-as-form&#34;&gt;Nature as Form&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For A., however, nature can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; refer to the form (&lt;em&gt;morphē&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; of each thing. Aristotle offers three arguments for this conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogy with the Products of Craft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 193a28&amp;ndash;b5 (Charlton tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is one way of using the word &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo;: for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the primary underlying matter in each case, of things which have in themselves a source of their movements and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also used for the shape and form which accords with a thing&amp;rsquo;s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Argument for 2]&lt;/strong&gt; Just as that which is in accordance with art and artificial is called art, so that which is in accordance with nature and natural is called nature. And as in the one case we would not yet say that a thing is at all in accordance with art, or that it is [in accordance with] art, if it is a bed only in possibility, and has not yet the form of a bed, so with things constituted naturally: that which is flesh or bone only in possibility, before it acquires the form which accords with the account by which we define what flesh or bone is, does not yet have its proper nature, and is not a thing due to nature. So there is another way of speaking, according to which nature is the shape and form of things which have in themselves a source of their changes, something which is not separable except in respect of its account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P1
: We use &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; in the same way that we use &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;craft&amp;rdquo;, &lt;em&gt;technē&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P2
: We say things are (what they are) in accordance with art only when they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; possess the form imposed on them by the relevant art.
-   &lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; Wood that is &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; a bed is not yet in accordance with art; only when it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; has the form of a bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C
: &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt;, by analogy, we say things are (what they are) in accordance with nature only when they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; possess &amp;ldquo;the form which accords with the account by which we define&amp;rdquo; what it is.
-   &lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; What is &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; flesh or bone is not yet in accordance with nature [= the nature of flesh/bone?]; only when it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; has the relevant form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parity of Reasoning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As A. suggests in the previous argument, nature is also &amp;ldquo;the shape and form of things which have in themselves a source of their changes, something which is not separable except in respect of its account&amp;rdquo; (on which see &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.2). With the next argument, A. begins to make clear in what sense form can operate as a source of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument attempts to argue by &lt;strong&gt;parity of reasoning&lt;/strong&gt; with Antiphon&amp;rsquo;s bed argument earlier in the chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 193b8&amp;ndash;12 (RFH tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a human comes to be from a human, but not a bed from a bed. This is also why people say the shape is not nature but rather the wood, because if it grew it would not be a bed that came to be but wood. Hence if this is nature, so too must the form be nature, since human comes from human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature as End of Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In different ways, then, both nature-as-form and nature-as-matter seem to have a causal role in the origin and source of natural changes. Additionally, nature-as-form has a role to play as the end towards which a natural change proceeds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 193b&amp;ndash;18 (RFH tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, nature spoken of as coming-to-be is a path into nature (&lt;em&gt;hodos eis phusis&lt;/em&gt;). This is not like the practice of medicine, which is said to be a path, not into medicine, but to health. The reason is that the practice of medicine must not proceed to medicine, but from it, whereas nature does not stand to nature in this way. To the contrary, what grows, &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; growing, proceeds from something into something. What, then, is it that grows? It is not that from which, but rather that into which, it grows. Therefore form is nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note
: &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;phusis&lt;/em&gt;) derives from the Greek word for &amp;ldquo;grow&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;phuein&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. makes this point a bit more clearly in &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;194a28&amp;ndash;33 (RFH rough tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature is an end (&lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt;) and that for the sake of which (&lt;em&gt;hou heneka&lt;/em&gt;), for when in a continuous change there is some end, this [sc. the end] is the last and that for the sake of which. For this reason too the poet was ridiculous to say &amp;ldquo;he has reached the end for whose sake he was born&amp;rdquo;. For not everything which is last should be considered the end, but rather the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nature-as-cause&#34;&gt;Nature as Cause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For A., then, nature, understood as a principle of change, is &amp;ldquo;double&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;dichōs&lt;/em&gt;), both form and matter. The two senses, however, are not equal, since for A. form must be considered &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; nature than matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;193b6&amp;ndash;8 (RFH tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This [sc. form, morphē?] is nature rather than the matter. For each thing is more property said [to be what it is] when it is actually, rather than potentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this double conception of nature reflected in A.&amp;rsquo;s idea that nature is a kind of &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt;? To answer this question, we need to turn to &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, where A. outlines the different ways in which things are said to be a cause (&lt;em&gt;aitios&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;aition&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, 194b23&amp;ndash;195a3 (Charlton tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one way of speaking, that out of which as a constituent a thing comes to be is called a cause; for example, the bronze and the silver and their genera would be the causes respectively of a statue and a loving-cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to another, the form or model is a cause; this is the account of what the being would be, and its genera—thus the cause of an octave is the ratio of two to one, and more generally number—and the parts which come into the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there is the primary source of the change or the staying unchanged: for example, the man who has deliberated is a cause, the father is a cause of the child, and in general that which makes something of that which is made, and that which changes something of that which is changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, a thing may be a cause as the end. That is what something is for, as health might be what a walk is for. On account of what does he walk? We answer &amp;lsquo;To keep fit&amp;rsquo; and think that, in saying that, we have given the cause. And anything which, the change being effected by something else, comes to be on the way to the end, as slimness, purging, drugs, and surgical instruments come to be as means to health: all these are for the end, but differ in that the former are works [or functions, &lt;em&gt;erga&lt;/em&gt; ] and the latter tools [ &lt;em&gt;organa&lt;/em&gt; ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How nature-as-form and nature-as-matter map on to the notion of &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; in these senses is an important question for the remainder of &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2. We&amp;rsquo;ll pick up with it next Thursday, and then again next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;review&#34;&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Nature is an internal causal principle of change and rest in that which is by nature primarily and non-accidentally.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What kind of causal principle?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Answer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s complicated&amp;hellip;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1&amp;ndash;2:&lt;/strong&gt; Nature is &amp;ldquo;double&amp;rdquo;, both formal and material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.3:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Cause&amp;rdquo; is said in many ways: formal, material, efficient, and final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drawing-conclusions&#34;&gt;Drawing Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.7 A. consolidates some of these conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.7, 198a22&amp;ndash;31 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the causes being four, it is the business of the student of nature to know about them all, and if he refers his problems back to all of them, he will assign the ‘why’ in the way proper to his science—the matter, the form, the mover, that for the [25] sake of which. &lt;strong&gt;The last three often coincide; for the what and that for the sake of which are one, while the primary source of motion is the same in species as these.&lt;/strong&gt; For man generates man—and so too, in general, with all things which cause movement by being themselves moved; and such as are not of this kind are no longer inside the province of natural science, for they cause motion not by possessing motion or a source of motion in themselves, but being themselves incapable of [30] motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form, mover, and that for the sake of which are, in many cases, operations of &lt;strong&gt;formal nature&lt;/strong&gt; in natural substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, however, that matter too can operate as a source of motion, as when we say that something is heated due to the presence of fire. In natural substances (a plant or animal, say) these sorts of efficient causes cannot &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; be attributed to formal nature but rather &lt;strong&gt;material nature&lt;/strong&gt;. How do these two types of cause interact in nature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering this question is the topic of &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8&amp;ndash;9, which Aristotle devotes to arguing for two claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;nature belongs to the class of causes that act for the sake of something&amp;rdquo; (198b9&amp;ndash;10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.9:&lt;/strong&gt; The place of (material) necessity in nature, &amp;ldquo;for all writers ascribe things to this cause, arguing that since the hot and the cold and the like are of such and such a kind, therefore certain things necessarily are and come to be—and if they mention any other cause (one friendship and strife, [15] another mind), it is only to touch on it, and then good-bye to it&amp;rdquo; (198b10&amp;ndash;15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nature-as-a-final-cause&#34;&gt;Nature as a Final Cause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Observation&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Some things in nature do not happen for the sake of anything, &lt;em&gt;even though it benefits something&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the farmer benefits from the rain, it does not rain &lt;em&gt;for the sake of&lt;/em&gt; making the corn grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the tourism industry in Antalya benefits from sunny summer weather, the weather is not sunny &lt;em&gt;for the sake of&lt;/em&gt; the tourism industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; natural processes happen this way?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8, 16&amp;ndash;32 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difficulty presents itself: why should not nature work, not for the sake of something, nor because it is better so, but just as the sky rains, not in order to make the corn grow, but of necessity? (What is drawn up must cool, and what has been cooled must become water and descend, the result of this being that the corn grows.) [20] Similarly if a man’s crop is spoiled on the threshing-floor, the rain did not fall for the sake of this—in order that the crop might be spoiled—but that result just followed. Why then should it not be the same with the parts in nature, e.g. that our teeth should come up of necessity—the front teeth sharp, fitted for tearing, the [25] molars broad and useful for grinding down the food—since they did not arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with all other parts in which we suppose that there is purpose? Wherever then all the parts came about just what they would have been if they had come to be for an end, such things survived, being [30] organized spontaneously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish, as Empedocles says his ‘man-faced oxprogeny’ did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;aristotle-s-principal-argument-for-natural-teleology&#34;&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Principal Argument for Natural Teleology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8, 198b32&amp;ndash;199a8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it is impossible that this should be the true view. For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or for the most part come about in a given way; but of not one of the results of chance or spontaneity is this true. We do not [199a1] ascribe to chance or mere coincidence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows [5] that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A (very) rough reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P1
: For any product of nature, &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;, either &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; comes about by chance or &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; comes about for the sake of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P2
: If &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; comes about by nature, then &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; comes about (in the way it does) either always or for the most part (i.e. if nothing external interferes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P3
: Nothing that happens always or for the most part comes about by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C
: So, if &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; comes about by nature, then &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; comes about for the sake of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplement: Aristotle on Chance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. here seems to be relying on &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.4&amp;ndash;6, which argued that chance and spontaneity are distinct sorts of cause, in particular on this observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.5, 196b1&amp;ndash;16 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First then we observe that some things always come to pass in the same [10] way, and others for the most part. It is clearly of neither of these that chance, or the result of chance, is said to be the cause—neither of that which is by necessity and always, nor of that which is for the most part. But as there is a third class of events besides these two—events which all say are by chance—it is plain that there is such [15] a thing as chance and spontaneity; for we know that things of this kind are due to chance and that things due to chance are of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle reiterates this observation in &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8 (199b16&amp;ndash;26, Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those things are natural which, by a continuous movement originated from an internal principle, arrive at some end: the same end is not reached from every principle; nor any chance end, but always the tendency in each is towards the same end, if there is no impediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end and the means towards it may come about by chance. We say, for instance, that a stranger has come by chance, paid the ransom, and gone away, [20] when he does so as if he had come for that purpose, though it was not for that that he came. This is accidental, for chance is an accidental cause, as I remarked before. But when an event takes place always or for the most part, it is not accidental or by [25] chance. In natural products the sequence is invariable, if there is no impediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions for Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might not A. be begging the question against his opponents? (More on this Thursday)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-craft-analogy&#34;&gt;The Craft Analogy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s conception of natural teleology relies on an important analogy with art (or craft, &lt;em&gt;technē&lt;/em&gt;), which in his view always operates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either to bring to completion what nature has not finished, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imitates nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8, 199a17&amp;ndash;18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, therefore, artificial products are for the sake of an end, so clearly are natural products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s the analogy is strict: apart from the fact that the causes of artificial products are external to the products themselves, art and nature are purposive in the same way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8, 199b26&amp;ndash;30 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present because we do not observe the agent deliberating. Art does not deliberate. If the ship-building art were in the wood, it would produce the same results by nature. If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature. The best illustration is a doctor doctoring himself: [30] nature is like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-kinds-of-necessity&#34;&gt;Two Kinds of Necessity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.8, Aristotle associated form with &amp;ldquo;the cause in the sense of that for the sake of which&amp;rdquo; (199a30&amp;ndash;33).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, when Aristotle turns to the role of necessity (&lt;em&gt;anankē&lt;/em&gt;) in nature, he argues for a subordinate causal role for material nature in natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, however, he has to clarify the sense in which it is true to say that things happen &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; in nature. Again he relies on an analogy with craft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 199b33&amp;ndash;200a14 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current view places what is of necessity in the process of production, just as if one were to suppose that the wall of a house [200a1] necessarily comes to be because what is heavy is naturally carried downwards and what is light to the top, so that the stones and foundations take the lowest place, with earth above because it is lighter, and wood at the top of all as being the lightest. Whereas, though the wall does not come to be without these, it is not due to these, [5] except as its material cause: it comes to be for the sake of sheltering and guarding certain things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly in all other things which involve that for the sake of which: the product cannot come to be without things which have a necessary nature, but it is not due to these (except as its material); it comes to be for an end. For instance, why is a saw such as it is? To effect so-and-so and for the sake of so-and-so. This [10] end, however, cannot be realized unless the saw is made of iron. It is, therefore, necessary for it to be of iron, if we are to have a saw and perform the operation of sawing. &lt;strong&gt;What is necessary then, is necessary on a hypothesis, not as an end. Necessity is in the matter, while that for the sake of which is in the definition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Observation&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It seems that we can explain a number of natural processes by focusing only on the necessary (efficient causal) effects of matter, e.g. heatings and coolings, hardenings and softenings, etc.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this make the role of formal nature as a final cause &lt;em&gt;redundant&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Answer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No! All that happens &amp;ldquo;of necessity&amp;rdquo; in these natural processes is conditional on a hypothesis, namely: that there is to be an &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 200a24&amp;ndash;29 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If then there is to be a house, such-and-such things must be made or be there already or exist, or generally [25] the matter relative to the end, bricks and stones if it is a house. But the end is not due to these except as the matter, nor will it come to exist because of them. Yet if they do not exist at all, neither will the house, or the saw—the former in the absence of stones, the latter in the absence of iron&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; (without which not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 1.7&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The principles of coming to be are three - form, privation, and subject.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2.1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These principles can be consigned to matter (subject) and form (form and privation).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;There is a third principle &amp;ldquo;present over and above&amp;rdquo; matter and form&amp;hellip;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 335a28&amp;ndash;32 (Joachim tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles, then, are equal in number to, and identical in
kind with, those in the sphere of the eternal and primary
things. For there is one in the sense of matter, and a second in
the sense of form; and, in addition, the third must be present
[30] as well. For the two are not sufficient to bring things into
being, any more than they are adequate to account for the
primary things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;against-purely-material-explanations-of-generation&#34;&gt;Against &amp;ldquo;Purely Material&amp;rdquo; Explanations of Generation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matter is &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 335b30&amp;ndash;34 (Joachim tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For, to begin with, it is characteristic of matter to suffer
action, i.e. to be moved; but to move, i.e. to act, belongs to a
different power. This is obvious both in the things that
come-to-be by art and in those that come-to-be by nature.
Water does not of itself produce out of itself an animal; and it
is the art, not the wood, that makes a bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Omits the more controlling cause&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 335b34&amp;ndash;5 (Joachim tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is this their only error. They make a second mistake in omitting the more
controlling cause; for they eliminate the essential nature, i.e.
the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes &lt;em&gt;instruments&lt;/em&gt; used by the cause for the cause itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 336a1&amp;ndash;14 (Joachim tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is more, since they remove the
formal cause, they invest the forces they assign to the simple
bodies—the forces which enable these bodies to bring things
into being—with too instrumental a character. For since (as
they say) it is the nature of the hot to dissociate, of the cold to
bring together, and of each remaining [5] contrary either to
act or to suffer action, it is out of such materials and by their
agency (so they maintain) that everything else comes-to-be
and passes-away. Yet it is evident that even Fire is itself
moved, i.e. suffers action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover their procedure is
virtually the same as if one were to treat the saw (and the
various instruments of [10] carpentry) as the cause of the
things that come-to-be; for the wood must be divided if a man
saws, must become smooth if he planes, and so on with the
remaining tools. Hence, however true it may be that Fire is
active, i.e. sets things moving, there is a further point they fail
to observe—viz. that Fire is inferior to the tools or
instruments in the manner in which it sets things moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;against-purely-formal-explanations-of-generation&#34;&gt;Against &amp;ldquo;Purely Formal&amp;rdquo; Explanations of Generation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; hypothesis regarding &amp;ldquo;the cause of generation and destruction&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plato, &lt;em&gt;Phaedo&lt;/em&gt; 100d&amp;ndash;101d (Grube tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer understand or recognize those other sophisticated causes,
and if someone tells me that a thing is beautiful because it has a bright
color or shape or any such thing, I ignore these other reasons—for all these
confuse me—but I simply, naively and perhaps foolishly cling to this, that
nothing else makes it beautiful other than the presence of, or the sharing
in, or however you may describe its relationship to that Beautiful we
mentioned, for I will not insist on the precise nature of the relationship,
but that all beautiful things are beautiful by the Beautiful. That, I think,
is the safest answer I can give myself or anyone else. And if I stick to this
I think I shall never fall into error. This is the safe answer for me or anyone
else to give, namely, that it is through Beauty that beautiful things are
made beautiful. Or do you not think so too?—I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then would you not avoid saying that when one is added to one it is
the addition and when it is divided it is the division that is the cause of
two? And you would loudly exclaim that you do not know how else each
thing can come to be except by sharing in the particular reality in which
it shares, and in these cases you do not know of any other cause of becoming
two except by sharing in Twoness, and that the things that are to be two
must share in this, as that which is to be one must share in Oneness, and
you would dismiss these additions and divisions and other such subtleties,
and leave them to those wiser than yourself to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objections to the view&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;intermittancy&amp;rdquo; of generation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 335b18&amp;ndash;20 (Joachim tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if the Forms
are causes, why is their generating activity intermittent
instead of perpetual and continuous—since there always are
participants as well as Forms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignores other causes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 335b20&amp;ndash;24 (Joachim tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, in some instances we see [20]
that the cause is other than the Form. For it is the doctor who
implants health and the man of science who implants science,
although Health itself and Science itself are as well as the
participants; and the same principle applies to everything else
that is produced in accordance with a capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-third-principle&#34;&gt;The Third Principle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, 335a33&amp;ndash;b8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now cause, in the sense of matter, for the things which are
such as to come-to-be is that which can be and not be; and
this is identical with that which can come to be and pass
away, since the latter, while it is at one time, at another time
is not. (For whereas some things are of necessity, viz. the
eternal things, others of necessity are not. And of these two
sets of things, since they cannot diverge from the [335b1]
necessity of their nature, it is impossible for the first not to be
and impossible for the second to be. Other things, however,
can both be and not be.) Hence coming-to-be and
passing-away must occur within the field of that which can be
and not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, therefore, is cause in the sense of matter for
the things which are such as to [5] come-to-be; while cause,
in the sense of their end, is their figure or form—and that is
the formula expressing the substance of each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the third principle must be present as well—the cause
vaguely dreamed of by all our predecessors, definitely stated
by none of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, A. does not refer to the third cause by name, but it should be clear what sort of cause A.&amp;rsquo;s objections to the &amp;ldquo;purely material&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;purely formal&amp;rdquo; accounts of change point to: &lt;strong&gt;the mover&lt;/strong&gt; (typically&amp;mdash;among perishable things&amp;mdash;the efficient cause).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Theoretical Sciences&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sciences that aim at no end beyond understanding itself.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physics (Natural Philosophy):&lt;/strong&gt; Studies beings that are movable and inseparable from matter &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; movable and inseparable (in thought) from matter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What makes &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; identical to the study of being as such?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;being-is-said-in-many-ways&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being is said in many ways&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle is committed to the existence of a unified science of being&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Γ.1 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a science which investigates being as being and
the attributes which belong to this in virtue of its own nature.
Now this is not the same as any of the so-called special
sciences; for none of these others deals generally with being
as [25] being. They cut off a part of being and investigate the
attributes of this part—this is what the mathematical sciences
for instance do. Now since we are seeking the first principles
and the highest causes, clearly there must be some thing to
which these belong in virtue of its own nature. If then our
predecessors who sought the elements of existing things were
seeking these same principles, it is necessary that the [30]
elements must be elements of being not by accident but just
because it is being. Therefore it is of being as being that we
also must grasp the first causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a problem&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being is said in many ways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.1, 1028a9&amp;ndash;12 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several senses in which a thing may be said to
be, as we pointed [10] out previously in our book on the
various senses of words; for in one sense it means what a
thing is or a ‘this’, and in another sense it means that a thing
is of a certain quality or quantity or has some such predicate
asserted of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being has a &amp;ldquo;primary sense&amp;rdquo;, namely &lt;strong&gt;substance&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.1, 1028a12&amp;ndash;19 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ‘being’ has all these senses, obviously
that which is primarily is the ‘what’, which indicates the
substance of the thing. For when we say of what quality a
thing is, we say that it is [15] good or beautiful, but not that it
is three cubits long or that it is a man; but when we say what
it is, we do not say ‘white’ or ‘hot’ or ‘three cubits long’, but
‘man’ or ‘God’. And all other things are said to be because
they are, some of them, quantities of that which is in this
primary sense, others qualities of it, others affections of it,
and others some other determination of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background to the Solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being is spoken of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;pros hen&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, i.e. in relation to one, primary referent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Γ.2, 1003a33&amp;ndash;b18 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many senses in which a thing may be said to ‘be’, but they are related to one central point, one definite kind of thing, and are not homonymous. [35]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything which is healthy is related to health, one thing in the sense that it preserves health, another in the sense that it produces it, another in the sense that it is a symptom of health, another because it is capable of it. And that which is [1003b1] medical is relative to the medical art, one thing in the sense that it possesses it, another in the sense that it is naturally adapted to it, another in the sense that it is a function of the medical art. And we shall find other words used similarly to these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5] So, too, there are many senses in which a thing is said to be, but all refer to one starting-point; some things are said to be because they are substances, others because they are affections of substance, others because they are a process towards substance, or destructions or privations or qualities of substance, or productive or generative of substance, or of things which are relative to substance, or negations of [10] some of these things or of substance itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As, then, there is one science which deals with all healthy things, the same applies in the other cases also. [&amp;hellip;] It is clear then that it is the work of one science [15] also to study all things that are, qua being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everywhere science deals chiefly with that which is primary, and on which the other things depend, and in virtue of which they get their names. If, then, this is substance, it is of substances that the philosopher must grasp the principles and the causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the grand conclusion of &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.1 (1028b3&amp;ndash;5, Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed the question which, both now and of old, has
always been raised, and always been the subject of doubt, viz.
what being is, is just the question, what is [5] substance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside on First Philosophy as Theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question
: What is &amp;ldquo;being&amp;rdquo; in the primary sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer
: Substance, but &amp;ldquo;there are three kinds of substance&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Λ.1):
-   &lt;strong&gt;Natural:&lt;/strong&gt; i.e., movable, of which there are two kinds:
-   &lt;strong&gt;Perishable:&lt;/strong&gt; Plants, animals, their parts, simple bodies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     -   **Eternal:** Celestial substances

 -   **Immovable:** Unchanging, separable from matter.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immovable substance&lt;/strong&gt; is the first principle of all (and, according to many commentators, being in the primary sense):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Λ.6, 1071b3&amp;ndash;21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there were three kinds of substance, two of them
natural and one unmovable, regarding the latter we must
assert that it is necessary that there should
be an eternal unmovable substance. For substances are the
first of existing things, [5] and if they are all destructible, all
things are destructible. But it is impossible that movement
should either come into being or cease to be; for it must
always have existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must, then, be such a principle, whose very substance is
[20] actuality. Further, then, these substances must be without
matter; for they must be eternal, at least if anything else is
eternal. Therefore they must be actuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-project-of-metaphysics-z&#34;&gt;The Project of &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the question, &amp;ldquo;what is subsance (&lt;em&gt;ousia&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.2, 1028b27&amp;ndash;33 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding these matters, then, we must inquire which of the
common statements are right and which are not right, and
what things are substances, and whether there are or are not
any besides sensible substances, and how sensible [30]
substances exist, and whether there is a separable substance
(and if so why and how) or there is no substance separable
from sensible substances; &lt;strong&gt;and we must first sketch the nature&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;of substance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-the-nature-of-substance&#34;&gt;What is the nature of substance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.3, 1028b34&amp;ndash;1029a6 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word ‘substance’ is applied, if not in more senses, still at least to four main objects; for both &lt;strong&gt;(1) the essence&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(2) the universal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(3) the genus&lt;/strong&gt; are thought to be [35] the substance &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;of each thing&lt;/span&gt;, and fourthly &lt;strong&gt;(4) the substratum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;(4) the substratum&lt;/strong&gt; is that of which other things are predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything else. And so we must first determine the nature of this; &lt;strong&gt;for that which underlies a [1029a1] thing primarily is thought to be in the truest sense its substance.&lt;/strong&gt; And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in one sense &lt;strong&gt;(4a) matter&lt;/strong&gt; is said to be of the nature of substratum,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in another, &lt;strong&gt;(4b) shape&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a third sense, &lt;strong&gt;(4c) the compound of these&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the matter I mean, for instance, the bronze, by the shape the plan of its form, and by the compound of these (the concrete thing) the [5] statue. Therefore if the form is prior to the matter and more real, it will be prior to the compound also for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Observation 1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Aristotle moves quickly from the question &amp;ldquo;what is substance&amp;rdquo; to the question &amp;ldquo;what is the substance &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;of each thing&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rdquo;? (Cf. the following lines: &amp;ldquo;We have now outlined &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;the nature of substance&lt;/span&gt;, showing that it is that which is not predicated of a subject, but of which all else is predicated.&amp;quot;)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Are these questions equivalent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Observation 2&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Aristotle offers four candidates for an answer to the question(s) &amp;ldquo;what is substance?&amp;rdquo; and/or &amp;ldquo;what is the substance of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of (&amp;ldquo;what-being-is for&amp;rdquo;) &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The universal to which &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; (qua substance?) belongs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The genus to which &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; belongs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The substatum of (that which underlies) &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedure of &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z :: Aristotle will create problems for &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of these candidates, only to propose (in Z.17) an entirely different account of substance grounded in the notion that substance is a &lt;em&gt;cause of being&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;substance-as-substratum--z-dot-3&#34;&gt;Substance as Substratum (Z.3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Why cannot the substance of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; be identified with that which underlies &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Answer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If it were, &amp;ldquo;matter becomes substance&amp;rdquo;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.3, 1029a9&amp;ndash;32 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if this is not substance, it is [10] beyond us to say what else is. When all else is taken away evidently nothing but matter remains. For of the other elements some are affections, products, and capacities of bodies, while length, breadth, and depth are quantities and not substances. For a quantity is not a substance; but the substance is rather that to [15] which these belong primarily. But when length and breadth and depth are taken away we see nothing left except that which is bounded by these, whatever it be; so that to those who consider the question thus matter alone must seem to be substance. &lt;strong&gt;By matter I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor of a [20] certain quantity nor assigned to any other of the categories by which being is determined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this is impossible; for both separability and individuality are thought to belong chiefly to substance. And so form and the compound of form and matter would be thought to be substance, rather than matter.&lt;/strong&gt; The substance compounded of both, [30] i.e. of matter and shape, may be dismissed; for it is posterior and its nature is obvious. And matter also is in a sense manifest. But we must inquire into the third kind of substance [i.e., form]; for this is the most difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;substance-as-essence--z-dot-4-6&#34;&gt;Substance as Essence (Z.4&amp;ndash;6)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions arising:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there essences &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; of substances like Socrates, or can there be an essence of &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;being in Athens&lt;/em&gt; as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If only of substance:&lt;/strong&gt; What defines what it is to be &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If not only of substance:&lt;/strong&gt; Then, absurdy, &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt; would be substance, if substance is essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2:&lt;/strong&gt; If the essence is the substance of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, and if &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is identical with its substance, can &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; be identical with the essence of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If yes:&lt;/strong&gt; Contradictions abound! (The &amp;ldquo;pale man&amp;rdquo; argument&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If no:&lt;/strong&gt; What would explain the difference between a thing and its essence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;q1--z-dot-4&#34;&gt;Q1 (Z.4)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Answer to Q1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Essence belongs &lt;em&gt;primarily&lt;/em&gt; to substance, but &lt;em&gt;derivatively&lt;/em&gt; to items in non-substance categories&amp;hellip;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1030a27&amp;ndash;b13 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we must inquire how we should express ourselves on each point, but still more how the facts actually stand. And so now also since it is evident what language we use, &lt;strong&gt;essence will belong, just as the ‘what’ does, primarily and in the simple sense to substance, and in a secondary way to the other categories also,—not essence [30] simply, but the essence of a quality or of a quantity.&lt;/strong&gt; For it must be either homonymously that we say these are, or by making qualifications and abstractions (in the way in which that which is not known may be said to be known),—the truth being that we use the word neither homonymously nor in the same sense, but just as we apply the word ‘medical’ when there is a reference to one and the same thing, not meaning one and the same thing, nor yet speaking homonymously; for a patient and [1030b1] an operation and an instrument are called medical neither homonymously nor in virtue of one thing, but with reference to one thing. But it does not matter in which of the two ways one likes to describe the facts; this is evident, that &lt;strong&gt;definition and essence in the primary and simple sense belong to substances. Still they belong to [5] other things as well in a similar way, but not primarily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;q1--z-dot-6&#34;&gt;Q1 (Z.6)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer unclear&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pale Man Argument (1031a19&amp;ndash;25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pale man is the same as the essence of the pale man (&amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to Q2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The man is the same as the pale man (assumption)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt;, the essence of the man is the same as the essence of the pale man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thing can&amp;rsquo;t be separate from its essence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1031b28&amp;ndash;1032a4 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absurdity of the separation would appear also if one were to assign a name to each of the essences; for there would be another essence besides the original one, e.g. to the essence of horse there will belong a second essence. Yet why should not [30] some things be their essences from the start, since essence is substance? &lt;strong&gt;But not only are a thing and its essence one, but the formula of them is also the same, as is [1032a1] clear even from what has been said; for it is not by accident that the essence of one, and the one, are one. Further, if they were different, the process would go on to infinity; for we should have the essence of one, and the one, so that in their case also the same infinite regress would be found. Clearly, then, each primary and self-subsistent thing is one and the same as its essence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-dot-2-solutions-substance-as-a-cause-of-being&#34;&gt;4.2 | Solutions: Substance as a Cause of Being&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.17, 1041a6&amp;ndash;22 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should say what, and what sort of thing, substance is, taking another starting-point; for perhaps from this we shall get a clear view also of that substance which exists apart from sensible substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, then, &lt;strong&gt;substance is a principle and a cause&lt;/strong&gt;, let us attack it from this standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Observation&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The ‘why’ is always [10] sought in this form—‘why does one thing attach to another?’ For to inquire why the musical man is a musical man, is either to inquire—as we have said—why the man is musical, or it is something else.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Objection&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Now ‘why a thing is itself’ is doubtless a meaningless inquiry; for the fact or the existence of the thing must already be [15] evident (e.g. that the moon is eclipsed), but &lt;strong&gt;the fact that a thing is itself is the single formula and the single cause to all such questions as why the man is man, or the musical musical,&lt;/strong&gt; unless one were to say that each thing is inseparable from itself; and its being one just meant this.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Revision&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This, however, is common to all things and is a short and easy way with the question. But we can inquire why man is an animal of [20] such and such a nature. Here, then, we are evidently not inquiring why he who is a man is a man. We are inquiring, then, why something is predicable of something&amp;hellip;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;P1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;For any item of knowledge, &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, either one knows &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; or one does not know &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;P2&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If one knows &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, one cannot inquire about &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;P3&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If one does not know &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, one cannot inquire about &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;C&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Therefore, one cannot inquire about &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Aristotle&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;all &amp;ldquo;inquiry&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;zētēsis&lt;/em&gt;) is a &amp;ldquo;search for the &amp;ldquo;middle term&amp;rdquo;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inquiry begins with prior knowledge of the &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;hoti&lt;/em&gt;), some universal fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there the inquirer seeks to know the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;dihoti&lt;/em&gt;), the explanation of that universal fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The why is given by the middle term of a demonstration of the fact known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;Why is the moon eclipsed?&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;Because the earth is interposed between it and the sun!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Conclusion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So, the moon is eclipsed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-indemonstrability-of-principles&#34;&gt;The Indemonstrability of Principles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some demonstrations it will be possible to ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; even about the premises, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Why do broad-leafed plants shed their leaves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; M = their sap coagulates at the stem of the leaf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on pain of an infinite regress, there must be demonstrative premises about which one cannot coherently ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;APo&lt;/em&gt; 1.3). these &amp;ldquo;first principles&amp;rdquo; will therefore be &amp;ldquo;immediate&amp;rdquo; because &amp;ldquo;unmiddled&amp;rdquo;; there is no middle term explaining the connection between subject and predicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Proposal&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Substance can be understood as the &lt;strong&gt;cause of being&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Objection&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Causal explanations are explanations of why some predicate belongs to some subject per se and in virtue of its essence, but to say that (e.g.) a human being is a rational animal is not a predication but a definition!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Revision&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Definitions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be understood as a kind of predication and as a subject of scientific inquiry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.17, 1041a22&amp;ndash;b32 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; it is predicable must be clear; for if not, the inquiry is an inquiry into nothing. [25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E.g. why does it thunder?—why is sound produced in the clouds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the inquiry is about the predication of one thing of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why are certain things, i.e. stones and bricks, a house?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plainly we are seeking the cause. And this is the essence (to speak abstractly), which in some cases is that for the sake of which, e.g. perhaps [30] in the case of a house or a bed, and in some cases is the first mover; for this also is a cause. But while the efficient cause is sought in the case of genesis and destruction, the final cause is sought in the case of being also.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-substance-as-the-cause-of-being-of-a-house&#34;&gt;Example: Substance as the Cause of Being of a House&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This configuration of stones and bricks is a house.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Why is this configuration of stones and bricks a house?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Demonstrative Explanation&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Because they are a shelter for persons and their possessions (= SHELTER)!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Major Premise&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Every SHELTER is a house&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Minor Premise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This configuration of stones and bricks is a SHELTER&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Conclusion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So, this configuration of stones and bricks is a house.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.17, 1041b6&amp;ndash;8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Clearly the question is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the matter is some individual thing, e.g. why are these materials a house? Because that which was the essence of a house is present. And why is this individual thing, or this body in this state, a man? &lt;strong&gt;Therefore what we seek is the cause, i.e. the form, by reason of which the matter is some definite thing; and this is the substance of the thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&amp;ldquo;That for the sake of which&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;E.g., why is this configuration of wood a bed? Because it is a platform for lying on, and this (say) is what it is to be a bed. Why is this configuration of flesh and bones (or an animal of such and such a sort) a human being? Because it is a rational animal, and this is just what a human being is.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&amp;ldquo;The first mover&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;E.g. why is this configuration of flesh and bones (or an animal of such and such a sort) going to be a human being? Because it is the production of a rational animal, and this is just what a human being is.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions-arising&#34;&gt;Questions Arising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s extension of the &lt;em&gt;Analytics&lt;/em&gt; model to explanations of the &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; (as opposed to per se attributes) of substances account for the &amp;ldquo;indemonstrability&amp;rdquo; of definitions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant text from &lt;em&gt;Posterior Analytics&lt;/em&gt; 2.10 (93b36&amp;ndash;94a12):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus one definition of definition is the one stated; another definition is an account which makes clear why a thing is. Hence the former type of definition signifies but does not prove, whereas the latter evidently will be a sort of [94a1] demonstration of what a thing is, differing in position from the demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For there is a difference between saying why it thunders and what thunder is; for in the one case you will say: Because the fire is extinguished in the clouds. What is thunder?—A noise of fire being extinguished in the clouds. Hence the same account [5] is put in a different way, and in this way it is a continuous demonstration, in this way a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a definition of thunder is noise in the clouds; and this is a conclusion of the demonstration of what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of immediates is an undemonstrable positing of what they are. [10] &lt;strong&gt;One definition, therefore, is an undemonstrable account of what a thing is; one is a deduction of what it is, differing in aspect from the demonstration; a third is a conclusion of the demonstration of what it is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about simple essences?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; Z.17, 1041b9&amp;ndash;10 (Ross tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, then, in the case of simple things no inquiry nor teaching is possible; but we must [10] inquire into them in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of what sorts of substances are the essences simple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Recall&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s answer to the central ontological question, &amp;ldquo;what is substance?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what is the substance of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;, is that &lt;strong&gt;substance is a cause of being&lt;/strong&gt;, understood here as &lt;strong&gt;form in its role as efficient and/or final cause&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;How does this this conception of substance as both form and cause of being influence Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s approach to natural science, in particular, his zoology or science of animal life?&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Aim&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;To determine the essence and attributes of soul.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 1.1, 402a1&amp;ndash;8 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We count cognition among the fine and honourable things, and suppose that one kind of cognition is finer and more honourable than another owing to its precision or because of its having better and more marvellous objects; and for both these reasons we may reasonably place an inquiry into the soul into the premier class of study. &lt;strong&gt;It also seems that research into the soul contributes greatly to truth in general, and most especially to truth about nature. For the soul is a sort of first principle of animals. We aim to consider and ascertain its nature and essence, and then its properties, of which some seem to be affections peculiar to the soul itself, while others belong to animals as well because of the soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Method&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;By studying both the form and matter of living things, as a natural scientist would!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 1.1, 402b16&amp;ndash;29 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it would seem that all the affections of the soul involve the body&amp;mdash;anger, gentleness, fear, pity, courage, as well as joy, and loving and hating. For at the same time as these, the body is affected in some way. This is shown by the fact that sometimes, even though strong and evident affections are present, we are not provoked or made afraid, while at other times we are moved by something small and obscure, whenever the body is agitated and in the condition it is in when angry. This is even clearer from the fact that sometimes though nothing frightful is present, people come to have the affections of a frightened person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is so, it is clear that the affections are accounts in matter. Consequently, definitions will be of this sort, for example: &amp;lsquo;being angry is (1) a sort of motion (2) of a body of such a sort, or of a part or capacity of a body, (3) brought about by this (4)  for the sake of that.&amp;rsquo; And for these reasons, a consideration of the soul, either all souls or this sort of soul, is already in the province of the natural scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aristotle-s-definition-of-soul-in-de-anima-2&#34;&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Definition of Soul in &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s postive account of soul begins in Book 2 of &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt;, which begins somewhat predictably but marks a radical change in the focus of psychological investigation. In summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Soul is the form and first actuality of an organic body, a body having the potential for life.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.2&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This can serve only as an &amp;ldquo;outline&amp;rdquo; account of soul, since &amp;ldquo;living is said in many ways&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.3&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;To formulate a &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; definition of soul&amp;mdash;one that explains how soul operates as the cause of life&amp;mdash;we must turn our attention to the principal &lt;em&gt;capacities&lt;/em&gt; of soul, including nutrition, reproduction, perception, locomotion, and thought.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-outline-account-of-soul-in-de-anima-2-dot-1&#34;&gt;The Outline Account of Soul in &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 412a 5&amp;ndash;22 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say that among the things that exist one kind is substance, and that one sort is substance as matter, which is not in its own right some this; another is shape and form, in accordance with which it is already called some this; and the third is what comes from these. Matter is potentiality, while form is actuality; and &lt;strong&gt;actuality is spoken of in two ways, first as knowledge is, and second as contemplating is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodies seem most of all to be substances, and among these, natural bodies, since these are the principles of the others. Among natural bodies, some have life and some do not have it. By &amp;lsquo;life&amp;rsquo; we mean that which has through itself nourishment, growth, and decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would follow that every natural body having life is a substance, and a substance as a compound. But since it is also a body of this sort-for it has life-the soul could not be a body; for the body is not among those things said of a subject, but rather is spoken of as a subject and as matter. &lt;strong&gt;It is necessary, then, that the soul is a substance as the form of a natural body which has life in potentiality. But substance is actuality; hence, the soul will be an actuality of a body of such a sort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two refinements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soul is the actuality in the way &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; is (= &lt;strong&gt;first actuality&lt;/strong&gt;) rather than the way &lt;em&gt;contemplating&lt;/em&gt; is (= &lt;strong&gt;second actuality&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 412a23&amp;ndash;29 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actuality is spoken of in two ways, first as knowledge is, and second as contemplating is. &lt;strong&gt;Evidently, then, the soul is actuality as knowledge is. For both sleeping and waking depend upon the soul&amp;rsquo;s being present; and as waking is analogous to contemplating, sleeping is analogous to having knowledge without exercising it. And in the same individual knowledge is prior in generation. Hence, the soul is the first actuality of a natural body which has life in potentiality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A body having the potential for life is an &lt;em&gt;organic&lt;/em&gt; (functionally organized) body:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 412b1&amp;ndash;6 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of body would be one which is organic. And even the parts of plants are organs, although altogether simple ones. For example, the leaf is a shelter of the outer covering, and the outer covering of the fruit; and the roots are analogous to the mouth, since both draw in nourishment. Hence, &lt;strong&gt;if it is necessary to say something which is common to every soul, it would be that the soul is the first actuality of an organic natural body&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--list-separator--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Complication: the &amp;ldquo;Ackrill Problem&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be the material cause of a process of generation, the body must be capable of receiving contrary forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, however, the body seems to be &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; enformed with soul; a dead body, or a body (or body part) lacking soul is a body only &lt;em&gt;homonymously&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 412b25&amp;ndash;27 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body which has cast off its soul is not a being which is potentially such as to be alive; this is rather the one that &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; soul. The seed, however, and the fruit, is such a body (= a body potentially such as to be alive?) in potentiality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, can the body be the matter for soul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-homonymy-of-life-in-de-anima-2-dot-2&#34;&gt;The Homonymy of Life in &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The account of soul offered in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1 is however only an &amp;ldquo;outline&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;general&amp;rdquo; account of soul, not a scientific definition specifying its &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt;. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.2, 413a11&amp;ndash;20 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because what is sure and better known as conforming to reason comes to be from what is unsure but more apparent, one must try to proceed anew in this way concerning the soul. &lt;strong&gt;For it is not only necessary that a defining account make clear the that, which is what most definitions state, but it must also contain and make manifest the cause. As things are, statements of definitions are like conclusions. For example: &amp;lsquo;what is squaring? It is an equilateral rectangle being equal to an oblong figure.&amp;rsquo; But this sort of definition is an account of the conclusion: the one who states that squaring is the discovery of a mean states the cause of the matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what Aristotle has in mind here, we need to appreciate a difficulty for the science of soul that Aristotle raised back in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 1.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 1.1, 402b5&amp;ndash;8 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one must take care not to overlook the question of whether&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is one account of soul, as there is one account of animal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or whether&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a different account for each type of soul, for example, of horse, of dog, of man, of god, while the universal animal is either nothing or is posterior to these;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it would be the same if any other common thing were being predicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.2, Aristotle offers reason for thinking that &amp;ldquo;there is a different account of each type of soul&amp;rdquo;, namely that &lt;em&gt;living is said in many ways&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.2, 413a21&amp;ndash;25 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say, then, taking up the beginning of the inquiry, that what is ensouled is distinguished from what is not ensouled by living. &lt;strong&gt;But living is spoken of in several ways.&lt;/strong&gt; And should even one of these belong to something, we say that it is alive: reason, perception, motion and rest with respect to place, and further the motion in relation to nourishment, decay, and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Nutrition (Growth, Decay, Reproduction)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Belongs to everything that is said to live, including &lt;strong&gt;plants&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;animals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Perception&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Belongs to &lt;strong&gt;animals&lt;/strong&gt; but not to &lt;strong&gt;plants&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Locomotion&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Belongs to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;animals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Reason&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Belongs to apparently one kind of animal: &lt;strong&gt;humans&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the assumption that soul is the cause of life in living things: how can there be a single account of soul, given how many different ways living is spoken of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-unity-of-psychology-de-anima-2-dot-3&#34;&gt;The Unity of Psychology: &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle showed in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.2 that no univocal definition (of the sort given in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1) of soul could capture its role as the cause of life in the many ways in which living things are said to live. Instead, we need to study the soul of each kind of living thing individually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, 414b25&amp;ndash;28 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, it is ludicrous to seek a common account in these cases, or in other cases, an account which is not peculiar to anything which exists, and which does not correspond to any proper and indivisible species, while neglecting what is of this sort. Consequently, &lt;strong&gt;one must ask individually what the soul of each is, for example, what the soul of a plant is, and what the soul of a man or a beast is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean, however, that there is not unified &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; of psychology, as opposed to a set of unrelated sciences of botany, zoology, and anthropology. To the contrary, there is a systematic relation among the capacities of soul present in plants, animals, and humans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, 414b29&amp;ndash;415a13 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What holds in the case of the soul is very close to what holds concerning figures: for &lt;strong&gt;in the case of both figures and ensouled things, what is prior is always present potentially in what follows in a series&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;for example, the triangle in the square, and the nutritive faculty in the perceptual faculty. One must investigate the reason why they are thus in a series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the percepual faculty is not without the nutritive, though the nutritive faculty is separated from the perceptual in plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, without touch, none of the other senses are present, though touch is present without the others; for many animals have neither sight nor hearing nor a sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, among things capable of perceiving, some have motion in respect of place, while others do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and most rarely, some have reasoning and understanding. For among perishable things, to those to which reasoning belongs all the remaining capacities also belong, though it is not the case that reasoning belongs to each of those with each of the others. Rather, imagination does not belong to some, while others live by this alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different account will deal with theoretical reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Represented schematically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The upshot?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&amp;ldquo;The account of each of these [sc. capacities of soul] will also be the most appropriate account of the soul [itself]&amp;rdquo; (415a14&amp;ndash;15).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-dot-2-closer-to-a-scientific-account-of-soul&#34;&gt;5.2 | Closer to a Scientific Account of Soul&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our discussion of &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2 left off with Aristotle on his way to a significant conclusion: the proper subject of the science of soul is not the soul itself but its constituent &lt;em&gt;capacities&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; including the capcities for nutrition, reproduction, locomotion, and thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does he arrive at this conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-unity-of-psychology&#34;&gt;The Unity of Psychology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle showed in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.2 that no univocal definition (of the sort given in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1) of soul could capture its role as the cause of life in the many ways in which living things are said to live. Instead, we need to study the soul of each kind of living thing individually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, 414b25&amp;ndash;28 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, it is ludicrous to seek a common account in these cases, or in other cases, an account which is not peculiar to anything which exists, and which does not correspond to any proper and indivisible species, while neglecting what is of this sort. Consequently, &lt;strong&gt;one must ask individually what the soul of each is, for example, what the soul of a plant is, and what the soul of a man or a beast is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean, however, that there is not unified &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; of psychology, as opposed to a set of unrelated sciences of botany, zoology, and anthropology. To the contrary, there is a systematic relation among the capacities of soul present in plants, animals, and humans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, 414b29&amp;ndash;415a13 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What holds in the case of the soul is very close to what holds concerning figures: for &lt;strong&gt;in the case of both figures and ensouled things, what is prior is always present potentially in what follows in a series&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;for example, the triangle in the square, and the nutritive faculty in the perceptual faculty. One must investigate the reason why they are thus in a series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the percepual faculty is not without the nutritive, though the nutritive faculty is separated from the perceptual in plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, without touch, none of the other senses are present, though touch is present without the others; for many animals have neither sight nor hearing nor a sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, among things capable of perceiving, some have motion in respect of place, while others do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and most rarely, some have reasoning and understanding. For among perishable things, to those to which reasoning belongs all the remaining capacities also belong, though it is not the case that reasoning belongs to each of those with each of the others. Rather, imagination does not belong to some, while others live by this alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different account will deal with theoretical reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Represented schematically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Therefore&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&amp;ldquo;The account of each of these [sc. capacities of soul] will also be the most appropriate account of the soul [itself]&amp;rdquo; (415a14&amp;ndash;15).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;consequences-of-this-conclusion&#34;&gt;Consequences of this Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle has defended the unity of psychology&amp;mdash;i.e., the idea that there is a science of &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt;, understood as a cause of living, over and above the sciences of (e.g.) human life (anthropology), animal life (zoology), and plant life (botany)&amp;mdash;by arguing that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological capcities can be shared by psychological kinds; and that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological capacities exhibit regular patterns of ontological dependence across psychological kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two important consequences follow from this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-soul-operates-as-cause-of-life-activities-in-various-ways&#34;&gt;The Soul Operates as Cause of Life Activities in Various Ways&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.4, 415b8&amp;ndash;28 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soul is the cause and principle of the living body. As these things are spoken of in many ways, so the soul is spoken of as a cause in the three of the ways delineated: for &lt;strong&gt;the soul is a cause (1) as the source of motion, (2) as that for the sake of which, and (3) as the substance of ensouled bodies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it is &lt;strong&gt;a cause as substance&lt;/strong&gt; is clear: for substance is the cause of being for all things, and living is being for living things, while the cause and principle of living is the soul. Further, actuality is the &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; of that which is potentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the soul is &lt;strong&gt;a cause as that for the sake of which&lt;/strong&gt;: just as reason acts for the sake of something, in the same way nature does so as well; and this is its end. And in living beings the soul is naturally such a thing. For all ensouled bodies are organs of the soul&amp;mdash;just as it is for the bodies of animals, so is it for the bodies of plants&amp;mdash;since they are for the sake of the soul. &amp;lsquo;That for the sake of which&amp;rsquo; is spoken of in two ways: that on account of which and that for which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the soul is also &lt;strong&gt;that from which motion&lt;/strong&gt; in respect of place &lt;strong&gt;first arises&lt;/strong&gt;, though this capacity does not belong to all living things. There are also alteration and growth in virtue of the soul; for perception seems to be a sort of alteration, and nothing perceives which does not partake of the soul. The same holds for both growth and decay; for nothing which is not nourished decays or grows naturally, and nothing is nourished which does not have a share of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consequence brings into clear focus exactly why a generic account of soul would fail to disclose the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; in which soul causes living things to live: namely because, depending on the kind of life (or life activity) in question, soul operates as cause in &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-dependencies-among-psychological-capacities-stand-in-need-of-explanation&#34;&gt;The Dependencies Among Psychological Capacities Stand in Need of Explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a consequence Aristotle acknowledges several times in &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.2 413b4&amp;ndash;10 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being alive, then, belongs to living things because of this principle, but something is an animal primarily because of perception. For even those things which do not move or change place, but which have perception, we call animals and not merely alive. The primary form of perception which belongs to all animals is touch. But just as the nutritive capacity can be separated from touch and from the whole of perception, so touch can be separated from the other senses. By nutritive we mean the sort of part of the soul of which even plants have a share. But all animals evidently have the sense of touch. &lt;strong&gt;The reason why both of these turn out to be the case we shall state later.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.2, 413b27&amp;ndash;414a4 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from these things, though, that the remaining parts of the soul are not separable, as some assert. That they differ in account, however, is evident; for what it is to be the perceptual faculty is different from what it is to be the faculty of belief, if indeed perceiving differs from believing, and so on for each of the other faculties mentioned. Further, all of these belong to some animals, and som of them to others, and only one to still others. And this will provide a differentiation among animals. &lt;strong&gt;It is necessary to investigate the reason why later.&lt;/strong&gt; Almost the same thing holds for the senses: for some animals have them all, others have some of them, and others have one, the most necessary, touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, 414b33&amp;ndash;415a1 (Shields tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One must investigate the reason why they are thus in a series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;explaining-the-serial-dependencies-among-psychological-capacities&#34;&gt;Explaining the Serial Dependencies Among Psychological Capacities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators usually look for the promised explanation in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 3.12&amp;ndash;13, where, among other things, Aristotle accounts for the presence of capacities in different psychological kinds by appeal to &lt;strong&gt;hypothetical necessity&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nutritive soul is necessary for &lt;strong&gt;all living things&lt;/strong&gt; to grow and reach (reproductive) maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perception is not necessary for plants, but for animals it is, since without the capacity to perceive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals could not acquire food,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor could they achieve &amp;ldquo;the goal (&lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt;) that is the function (&lt;em&gt;ergon&lt;/em&gt;) of their nature&amp;rdquo;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor could rational animals acquire &amp;ldquo;a discriminating mind&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;nous kritikos&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the senses are necessary for every kind of animal, since only animals who need locomotion in order to find food and avoid danger require the distance senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these &amp;ldquo;roaming&amp;rdquo; animals, moreover, these distance senses are present not only for the sake of being (&lt;em&gt;to einai&lt;/em&gt;) and survival (&lt;em&gt;sotēria&lt;/em&gt;), but also for the sake of &lt;em&gt;well-being&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;to eu&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--listend--&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;How does this answer the question of (e.g.) why all perceivers are also self-nourishers?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-clue-to-aristotle-s-strategy&#34;&gt;A Clue to Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt; 2.4, 415a23&amp;ndash;b7 (RFH tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the nutritive soul belongs also to the others, and is the primary and most common capacity of soul in respect of which living belongs to all. (Its functions are reproducing and [in general] using food.) &lt;strong&gt;For the most natural function for living things – those that are complete and not maimed or have spontaneous generation – is for it to produce another like itself, an animal an animal, a plant a plant, so that they may share as much as possible in the eternal and divine. For all strive for that, and do whatever they do by nature for the sake of that.&lt;/strong&gt; (And that for the sake of which is double: on the one hand that of which, on the other that for which.) So, since it cannot share in the eternal and divine in continuity, on account of the inability of any perishable thing to persist one and the same in number, each shares in it as much as it can partake, some more, some less; and not it but something like it persists, not one in number, but one in species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What makes it true to say that all living things do everything they do by nature for the sake of sharing as much as possible in the eternal and divine?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Possible Answer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The end for whose sake living things are endowed with the psychological capacities they naturally have is the activity that represents the best available means for that living thing to participate in the eternal and divine:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sterile or spontaneously generated animals (non-reproducers), that activity is &lt;strong&gt;nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;self-preservation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the vast majority of fertile living things, that activity is &lt;strong&gt;reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;, or eternal persistence &lt;em&gt;in kind&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For rational living things, that activity is &lt;strong&gt;theoretical contemplation&lt;/strong&gt; (see &lt;em&gt;EN&lt;/em&gt; 10.6&amp;ndash;8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;aristotle-s-place-in-the-history-of-genetics-and-embryology&#34;&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Place in the History of Genetics and Embryology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two controversies in the history of embryology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Preformationism vs. Developmentalism&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Do all the parts of the animal exist is a preformed state (e.g. as a &amp;ldquo;homonculus&amp;rdquo;) prior to conception and/or birth, or does they develop during gestation?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does generative seed reproduce manage to generate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the parts of the animal? Some options:
-   &lt;strong&gt;Panspermia (Hippocratic Treatises, Darwin):&lt;/strong&gt; Each part of the body contirbutes to the production of seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   **Information Theory (Modern Genetics):** Seed encodes _information_ about the plan of the entire body, a plan according to which gestation unfolds.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle has the honor of being on the right side of both of these debates&amp;mdash;a fact which led the Nobel laureate molecular biologist Max Delbrück to propose that Aristotle too be awarded the same prize for &amp;ldquo;the discovery of the principle implied in DNA&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delbrück 1971, 54&amp;ndash;55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put into modern language, what all these quotations [summarizing Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s position on these debates] is this: The form principle is the information which is stored in the semen. After fertilization it is read out in a preprogrammed way; the readout alters the matter upon which it acts, but it does not alter the stored information, which is not properly speaking, part of the finished product. In other words, if that committee in Stockholm, which has the unenviable task each year of pointing out the most creative scientists, had the liberty of giving awards posthumously, I think they should consider Aristotle for the discovery of the principle implied in DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-principles-of-aristotle-s-embryology&#34;&gt;The Principles of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Embryology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Delbrück alludes to, Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s account of animal generation relies fundamentally on his hylomorphism, and particularly on the idea that the principles of generation, the male and the female, correspond respectively to &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;, the active and passive principles of the process which brings about a new organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;agency-and-patiency-in-general&#34;&gt;Agency and Patiency in General&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this theory, Aristotle is relying on a general account of motion and change defended in &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 3.1&amp;ndash;3, according to which:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motion (&lt;em&gt;kinêsis&lt;/em&gt;) is the fullfillment of what is potenially, &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; potentially:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 3.1, 201a10ff. (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the fulfilment of what is potentially, as such, is motion—e.g. the fulfilment of what is alterable, as alterable, is alteration; of what is increasable and its opposite, decreasable (there is no common name for both), increase and decrease; of what can come to be and pass away, coming to be and passing away; of what can be carried along, locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of motion (the agent or mover) always moves the patient (or that which is moved) by being actually such as the moved is in potentiality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 3.2, 202a6ff. (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence motion is the fulfilment of the movable as movable, the cause being contact with what can move, so that the mover is also acted on. The mover will always transmit a form, [10] either a ‘this’ or such or so much, which, when it moves, will be the principle and cause of the motion, e.g. the actual man begets man from what is potentially man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every motion, then, is the actuality of both a mover (qua agent or mover) and a moved (qua patient or moved). This, however, gives rise to a puzzle: how can the same motion be the actuality of both moved and mover? Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s answer is that &lt;strong&gt;the actuality of the agent and patient are logically distinct aspects of a single motion located in the mover&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 3.3, 202a14ff. (Hardie and Gaye tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution of the difficulty is plain: motion is in the movable. It is the fulfilment of this potentiality by the action of that which has the power of causing [15] motion; and the actuality of that which has the power of causing motion is not other than the actuality of the movable; for it must be the fulfilment of both. A thing is capable of causing motion because it can do this, it is a mover because it actually does it. But it is on the movable that it is capable of acting. Hence there is a single actuality of both alike, just as one to two and two to one are the same interval, and the steep ascent and the steep descent are one—for these are one and the same, [20] although their definitions are not one. So it is with the mover and the moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-puzzle-for-animal-generation&#34;&gt;A Puzzle for Animal Generation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution is central to resolving an initial puzzle for animal generation, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 1.21, 729b1 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; how it is that the male contributes to generation and how it is that the semen from the male is the cause of the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it exist in the body of the embryo as a part of it from the first, mingling with the material which comes from [5] the female?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or does the semen communicate nothing to the material body of the embryo but only to the power and movement in it? For this power is that which acts and makes, while that which is made and receives the form is the residue of the secretion in the female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s answer is consistent with his solution to the puzzle concerning change in general from &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; 3:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 1.21, 729b9 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the latter alternative appears to be the right one both a priori and in view of the facts. For, if we consider the question on general grounds, [10] we find that, whenever one thing is made from two of which one is active and the other passive, the active agent does not exist in that which is made; and, still more generally, the same applies when one thing moves and another is moved. But the female, as female, is passive, and the male, as male, is active, and the principle of the movement comes from him. Therefore, if we take the highest genera under [15] which they each fall, the one being active and motive and the other passive and moved, that one thing which is produced comes from them only in the sense in which a bed comes into being from the carpenter and the wood, or in which a ball comes into being from the wax and the form. It is plain then that it is not necessary that anything at all should come away from the male, and if anything does come away it does not follow that this gives rise to the embryo as being in the embryo, but only as that which imparts the motion and as the form; so the medical art cures the [20] patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, the male principle acts as mover in the process of generation in the way the art of carpentry shapes the wood that comes to be a bed, namely, by imparting a series of motions (embodied in the tools of the carpenter&amp;rsquo;s trade) that act intermediately on the wood:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 1.22, 730b9 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these considerations we may also gather how it is that the male [10] contributes to generation. &lt;strong&gt;The male does not emit semen at all in some animals, and where he does this is no part of the resulting embryo; just so no material part comes from the carpenter to the material, i.e. the wood in which he works, nor does any part of the carpenter’s art exist within what he makes, but the shape and the form [15] are imparted from him to the material by means of the motion he sets up. It is his hands that move his tools, his tools that move the material; it is his knowledge of his art, and his soul, in which is the form, that move his hands or any other part of him with a motion of some definite kind, a motion varying with the varying nature of the [20] object made. In like manner, in the male of those animals which emit semen, nature uses the semen as a tool and as possessing motion in actuality, just as tools are used in the products of any art, for in them lies in a certain sense the motion of the art.&lt;/strong&gt; Such, then, is the way in which these males contribute to generation. But when the [25] male does not emit semen, but the female inserts some part of herself into the male, this is parallel to a case in which a man should carry the material to the workman. For by reason of weakness in such males nature is not able to do anything by any secondary means, but the movements imparted to the material are scarcely strong enough when nature itself watches over them. Thus here nature resembles a [30] modeller in clay rather than a carpenter, for she does not touch the work she is forming by means of tools, but with her own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;explaining-sexual-dimorphism-in-animals&#34;&gt;Explaining Sexual Dimorphism in Animals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Aristotle, the principles of animal generation are also the principles of plant generation, the only difference being that the male and female principles are &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; from one another in animals (although the unite, plantlike, in copulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle attributes the sexual differentiation of animals to the wisdom of animal nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 1.23, 731a24 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For to the essence of plants [25] belongs no other function or business than the production of seed; since, then, this is brought about by the union of male and female, nature has mixed these and set them together in plants, so that the sexes are not divided in them.&lt;/strong&gt; Plants, however, have been investigated elsewhere. &lt;strong&gt;But the function of the animal is not only to [30] generate (which is common to all living things), but they all of them participate also in a kind of knowledge, some more and some less, and some very little indeed. For they have sense-perception, and this is a kind of knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; (If we consider the value of this we find that it is of great importance compared with the class of lifeless objects, but of little compared with the use of the intellect. For against the latter the [731b1] mere participation in touch and taste seems to be practically nothing, but beside plants and stones it seems most excellent; for it would seem a treasure to gain even this kind of knowledge rather than to lie in a state of death and non-existence.) &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;Now it is by sense-perception that an animal differs from those organisms which have only life. But since, if it is a living animal, it must also live; therefore, when it is [5] necessary for it to accomplish the function of that which has life, it unites and copulates, becoming like a plant, as we said before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;PS&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I suspect that the underlined passage gives us a clue to what A. means when he claims in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.3 that the capacities prior in the series of souls are present potentially in the latter&amp;hellip;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Question&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This seems however to be only part of the explanation; we need further to see why the existence of an additional &lt;em&gt;cognitive&lt;/em&gt; function in animals accounts for their sexual dimorphism.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that Aristotle offers an answer, it comes in &lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, where Aristotle claims that sexual differentiation of animal species arises both on account of necessity and for the sake of an end:
-   &lt;strong&gt;Necessity:&lt;/strong&gt; Females are the result of the failure of the male principle to &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; the matter in embryological development; a product of material necessity. (&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 4.1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   **Teleology:** The male and female principles are separate in animals for the sake of the greater perfection of the superior principle, which (for Aristotle) is the male:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 731b24 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some existing things are eternal and divine whilst others admit of both [25] existence and non-existence. But that which is noble and divine is always, in virtue of its own nature, the cause of the better in such things as admit of being better or worse, and what is not eternal does admit of existence and non-existence, and can partake in the better and the worse. And soul is better than body, and the living, having soul, is thereby better than the lifeless which has none, and being is better [30] than not being, living than not living. These, then, are the reasons of the generation of animals. For since it is impossible that such a class of things as animals should be of an eternal nature, therefore that which comes into being is eternal in the only way possible. Now it is impossible for it to be eternal as an individual—for the substance of the things that are is in the particular; and if it were such it would be eternal—but it is possible for it as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why there is always a class of [732a1] men and animals and plants. But &lt;strong&gt;since the male and female are the first principles of these, they will exist in those things that possess them for the sake of generation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, as the first efficient or moving cause, to which belong the definition and the form, is better and more divine in its nature than the material on which it works, it is [5] better that the superior principle should be separated from the inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, wherever it is possible and so far as it is possible, the male is separated from the female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first principle of the movement, whereby that which comes into being is male, is better and more divine, and the female is the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The male, [10] however, comes together and mingles with the female for the work of generation, because this is common to both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No comment&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-embryogenesis&#34;&gt;Introduction to Embryogenesis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2, Aristotle turns from his discussion of the &lt;em&gt;principles&lt;/em&gt; of natural generation, the male and the female, to the question of how these principles generate offspring, a new substance the same in kind as the parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Female Principle&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The patient of natural generation; that which provides the matter for the substantial change.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Male Principle&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The agent of natural generation; that which shapes the matter into the&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By appeal to these principles, Aristotle applies the account of natural generation we saw him defend in &lt;em&gt;GC&lt;/em&gt; 2.9, although substantial puzzles remain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 733b24 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a considerable difficulty in understanding how the plant is formed out [25] of the seed or any animal out of the semen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that comes into being or is made must (1) be made out of something, (2) be made by the agency of something, and must (3) become something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now (1) that out of which it is made is the material; this some animals have in its first form within themselves, taking it from the female parent, as all those which are not born alive but produced as a grub or an egg; others receive it [30] from the mother for a long time by sucking, as the young of all those which are not only externally but also internally viviparous. Such, then, is the material out of which things come into being,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we now are inquiring not out of what the parts of an animal are made, but (2) by what agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2a) Either it is something external which makes them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2b) or else something existing in the seminal fluid and the semen; and this must either be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2b&#39;) soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2b&#39;&#39;) or a part of soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2b&#39;&#39;&#39;) or something containing soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generation-of-the-offspring&#34;&gt;Generation of the Offspring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-leaving-home-analogy&#34;&gt;The Leaving Home Analogy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzle over the nature of the male principle&amp;rsquo;s agency in natural generation results from a kind of dilemma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Man begets man&amp;rdquo;, so the cause of animal generation must be what is actually such as the offspring is potentially. Therefore the agent must be the male parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, change requires contact between agent and patent, but in many cases of animal generation the male parent is in contact with the female only indirectly, by means of the presence of the male seed in the uterus. If then, the cause of animal generation is what is actually such as what the offspring is potentially, the male seed must be actually alive, and an animal! [= 2b]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s solution to this puzzle is typical: we can distinguish a variety of ways in which a thing (e.g. the male seed) can be said to have soul:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.1, 735a9 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a thing existing potentially may be nearer or further from its realization in [10] actuality, just as a sleeping geometer is further away than one awake and the latter than one actually studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;C1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Accordingly it is not any part that is the cause of the soul’s coming into being, but it is the first moving cause from outside. (= 2a) &lt;strong&gt;For nothing generates itself, though when it has come into being it thenceforward increases itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;C2&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Hence it is that only one part comes into being first and not all of them together.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that must first come into being which has a principle of increase (for [15] &lt;strong&gt;this nutritive power exists in all alike, whether animals or plants, and this is the same as the power that enables an animal or plant to generate another like itself, that being the function of them all if naturally perfect&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is necessary for the reason that whenever a living thing is produced it must grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is produced, then, by something else of the same name, as e.g. man is produced by man, but it is [20] increased by means of itself. There is, then, something which increases it. If this is a single part, this must come into being first. Therefore if the heart is first made in some animals, and what is analogous to the heart in the others which have no heart, it is from this or its analogue that the first principle of movement would arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle compares this process to that of a son who leaves his father&amp;rsquo;s home to establish one for himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.4, 739b34 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the embryo is once formed, it acts like the seeds of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For seeds also [35] contain the first principle of growth in themselves, and when this (which previously exists in them only potentially) has been differentiated, the shoot and the root are [740a1] sent off from it, and it is by the root the plant gets nourishment; for it needs growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So also &lt;strong&gt;in the embryo all the parts exist potentially in a way, but the first principle is furthest on the road to realization&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the heart is first differentiated in [5] actuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is clear not only to the senses (for it is so) but also on theoretical grounds. &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;For whenever the young animal has been separated from both parents it must be able to manage itself, like a son who has set up house away from his father&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hence it must have a first principle from which comes the ordering of the body at a later stage also&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for if it is to come in from outside at a later period to dwell in it, not [10] only may the question be asked at what time it is to do so,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also we may object that, when each of the parts is separating from the rest, it is necessary that this principle should exist first from which comes growth and movement to the other parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have a lot to say about the primacy of the heart (or its analogue in bloodless animals) in embryogenesis. First, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the prior question of how it is that the embro is formed from the interaction of the male and female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;coming-to-be-of-the-embryo&#34;&gt;Coming-to-Be of the Embryo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen that Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s account of the agent of natural generation relies on the idea that that the male seed has soul potentially but not actually. In fact, this is a point Aristotle also makes about the female seed&amp;mdash;a fact confirmed in his eyes by the phenomenon of &amp;ldquo;wind-eggs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.3, 735b8 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is plain that the semen and the embryo (here = female seed), while not yet separate, must be assumed to have the nutritive soul potentially, but not actually, until (like those [10] embryos that are separated from the mother) it absorbs nourishment and performs the function of the nutritive soul. For at first all such embryos seem to live the life of a plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is clear that we must be guided by this in speaking of the sensitive and the rational soul. For all three kinds of soul, not only the nutritive, must be possessed potentially before they are possessed in actuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is necessary [15] either that they should all come into being in the embryo without existing previously outside it, or that they should all exist previously, or that some should so exist and others not. Again, it is necessary that they should either come into being in the material supplied by the female without entering with the semen of the male, or come from the male and be imparted to the material in the female. If the latter, then either all of them, or none, or some must come into being in the male from [20] outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle attributes to the male seed the cause of the coming into being of the perceptive soul (which is what makes the embryo an animal). Puzzlingly, though, neither it nor the female seed are responsible for the coming to be of the rational soul; rather, it comes from &amp;ldquo;without&amp;rdquo; (736b27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the male and female principles are jointly activated, their respective potentials for soul are brought into actuality. Aristotle compares this process to the curdling of milk in the process of cheese-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.4, 739b20 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20] When the material secreted by the female in the uterus has been fixed by the semen of the male (this acts in the same way as rennet acts upon milk, for rennet is a kind of milk containing vital heat, which brings into one mass and fixes the similar material, and the relation of the semen to the menstrual blood in the same, milk and [25] the menstrual blood being of the same nature)—when, I say, the more solid part comes together, the liquid is separated off from it, and as the earthy parts solidify membranes form all round it; this is both a necessary result and for the sake of something, the former because the surface of a mass must solidify on heating as well as on cooling, the latter because the foetus must not be in a liquid but be separated [30] from it. Some of these are called membranes and others choria, the difference being one of more or less, and they exist in ovipara and vivipara alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process however is not just one of determining a bodily distinction between the embryo and the female seed. Given Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s committment to the Homonymy Principle, no part of soul can be actually present in the embryo without the bodily organ necessary for its exercise. Hence, the &amp;ldquo;setting&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fixing&amp;rdquo; of the embryo must coincide with the formation of the bodily organ for the capacity (or capacities?) of soul responsible for the following functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;body plan&amp;rdquo;, the principle which determines the order of embryological development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle identifies this organ as the heart, or it&amp;rsquo;s analogue in bloodless animals. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-heart-and-its-role-in-embryogenesis&#34;&gt;The Heart and Its Role in Embryogenesis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-de-anima&#34;&gt;Background: &lt;em&gt;De Anima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this quesiton, I think we need to recall some important conclusions of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s discussion of nutritive soul in &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 2.4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;415a24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The nutritive soul is the capacity for both nutrition/growth and reproduction, both of which concern the processing and use of nutriment.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these functions, reproduction takes teleological primacy, both over nutrition/growth but also over the other capacities of the soul:
-   &lt;strong&gt;416b24&amp;ndash;25:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Since it is proper to call each thing after its &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; is to generate another like oneself, the primary soul would be the faculty of generating another like oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   **415a25--b7:** The teleologically primary activity of most living things---those that are not sterile or spontaneously generated---is to generate another like themselves, since this (= eternity in form) is the best available means for most living things to participate in the eternal and divine.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as I argued in connection with &lt;em&gt;DA&lt;/em&gt; 3.12&amp;ndash;13, the status of reproduction as the teleologically primary activity&amp;mdash;that activity for whose sake living things do all they do by nature&amp;mdash;enables Aristotle to explain the presence of other psychological capacities in living things by reference to their contribution to the living thing&amp;rsquo;s ability to reach reproductive maturity and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Nutrition/Growth&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;All living things must take in food in order to grow and reach reproductive maturity.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Sense Perception&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Animals require senses, minimally touch and taste, in order to acquire the food they need to nourish themselves and grow.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Senses:&lt;/strong&gt; Roaming animals additionally require distance senses in order to spot food (as well as potential threats) from afar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explanatory connection between reproduction and the other capacities and instrumental parts of the animal enables Aristotle to account for the order of the development of the parts of the animal in embrogenesis. In this sense, the nutritive soul contains the &amp;ldquo;body plan&amp;rdquo; of the entire organism, since the order of development and the ultimate morphology of the animal body will be the result of what it needs in order to achieve its teleologically primary activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;explaining-the-order-of-embryological-development&#34;&gt;Explaining the Order of Embryological Development&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s account of the order (&lt;em&gt;ti meta ti&lt;/em&gt;) of embryological development is designed to explain three key observations about animal development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the heart (or its analogue) develops first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the internal organs develop before the external parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the upper parts of the animal develop before the lower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Aristotle attempts to explain these facts by appeal to the &lt;em&gt;teleological&lt;/em&gt; character of embryological development. This order, he argues can be explained on analogy with acquiring knowledge of how to play a musical instrument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.6, 742a17 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with the parts as with other things; one naturally exists prior to another. But the word ‘prior’ is used in more senses than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For there is a difference between (1) the end or final cause and (2) that which exists for the sake of it; the latter is prior in order [20] of development, the former is prior in essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, that which exists for the sake of the end admits of division into two classes, (2a) first the origin of the movement, and then (2b) that which is used by the end; I mean, for instance, that which can generate, and that which serves as an instrument to what is generated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the one of these, that which makes, must exist first, as the teacher before the learner, and the other [25] later, as the pipes are later than he who learns to play upon them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for it is superfluous that men who do not know how to play should have pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus there are three things: (1) first, the end, by which we mean that for the sake of which something else exists; (2a) secondly, the principle of movement and of generation, [30] existing for the sake of the end (for that which can make and generate, considered simply as such, exists only in relation to what is made and generated); (2b) thirdly, the useful, that is to say what the end uses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle distinguishes three &lt;em&gt;relata&lt;/em&gt; of teleological priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;End&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;or that for the sake of which, e.g. the student learning to play the flute.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Source of Motion/Generation&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;which is for the sake of the End &lt;em&gt;as cause of its coming to be&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. the teacher, who causes the student to learn the flute.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Tools&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;which are for the sake of the End as instruments (ὀργανικά) used by the End for its exercise, e.g. flutes.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Source of Motion/Generation&lt;/strong&gt; must be prior in generation to the &lt;strong&gt;End&lt;/strong&gt;, since e.g. there can be no learner without a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;strong&gt;End&lt;/strong&gt; must be prior in generation to the &lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;since the latter are for the sake of the former&lt;/em&gt;:
-   Flutes are posterior to the learner, since &amp;ldquo;it is superfluous for one who does not know how to play the flute to have flutes&amp;rdquo; (742a27&amp;ndash;28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   Likewise, it would be superfluous for the end to possess tools which it could not yet use.

-   _Hence_, the end must be developmentally prior to what is for the sake of it, but not as a source of motion/generation.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle uses this distinction in particular to explain the developmental priority of the part that contains the principle described above, i.e. the heart or its analogue, relative to the other parts of the body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.6, 742a33 ff. (RFH tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that, it is necessary for there first to be some part in which the principle of motion is present&amp;mdash;for of course this part too is one part of the end, indeed the most controlling part). Next, after this [it is necessary for there to be] the whole and the end. Third and finally, [it is necessary for there to be] the parts instrumental for these [sc. previous parts] in relation to various uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore if there is any such [part] that must be present in animals, [viz.] the part containing the source and end of [the animal&amp;rsquo;s] entire nature, this must be generated first: first qua productive of motion, but along with the whole qua part of the end.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore those among the instrumental parts that are generative of the [animal&amp;rsquo;s] nature must in every case be present first, since they are for the sake of something else as principle, whereas those which are not such among the things for the sake of something else are posterior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s claim is that the part that &amp;ldquo;contains the source and end of [the animal&amp;rsquo;s] entire nature&amp;rdquo; (742b1&amp;ndash;3) develops first &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Source of Motion&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. organ of nutritive soul in its &lt;em&gt;threptic&lt;/em&gt; capacity), then &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; (part of the) &lt;strong&gt;End&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. organ of nutritive soul in its &lt;em&gt;reproductive&lt;/em&gt; capacity, perhaps as well as ultimate organ of perception; cf. 743b26&amp;ndash;28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;animal-nature-as-a-good-household-manager&#34;&gt;Animal Nature as a Good Household Manager&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accounts for the developmental priority of the heart. What about that of the upper parts relative to the lower parts and the internal parts relative to the external parts? The same sort of explanation applies, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.6, 742b13 ff. (Platt tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for this reason that part which contains the first principle comes into being first, next to this the upper half of the body. This is why [15] the parts about the head, and particularly the eyes, appear largest in the embryo at an early stage, while the parts below the umbilicus, as the legs, are small; for the lower parts are for the sake of the upper, and are neither parts of the end nor able to form it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All tolled, Aristotle envisions a 4-stage process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stage 1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The heart (or its analogue) &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; organ of generative principle.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stage 2&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The heart (or its analogue) &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; organ of animal&amp;rsquo;s natural end.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stage 3&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo; parts that are &amp;ldquo;parts of the end&amp;rdquo; [= organs for vital activities present for the sake of realizing the teleologically primary activity]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stage 4&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo; parts that are not &amp;ldquo;parts of the end&amp;rdquo; [= organs present for the sake of vital activities]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a material component to these relations of developmental priority and posteriority, a component Aristotle takes to be reflected in the quality of the material (nutriment) from which each part is developed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GA&lt;/em&gt; 2.6, 744b11&amp;ndash;27 (Leunissen tr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the other parts [i.e., instrumental parts arising in &lt;strong&gt;Stages 3&amp;ndash;4&lt;/strong&gt; ] is formed out of the nutriment, [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 3&lt;/strong&gt; ] the parts that are the noblest and that partake in the most important principle are formed from the nutriment which is concocted first and is purest; [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 4&lt;/strong&gt; ] the parts that are necessary, that is to say that are for the sake of the former parts, are formed from the inferior nutriment and the residues and leftovers. For just like a good housekeeper, so also nature is not in the habit of throwing away anything from which it is possible to make anything useful. Now in a household the best part of the food that comes in is set apart for [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 3&lt;/strong&gt; ] the free people, the inferior and the residue for [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 4.1&lt;/strong&gt; ] the slaves, and the worst is given to [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 4.2&lt;/strong&gt; ] the animals that live with them. Just as the intellect from the outside does those things with a view to growth, so nature in the things coming to be forms from the purest material [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 3&lt;/strong&gt; ] the flesh and the body of the other sense organs, and from the residues thereof [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 4.1&lt;/strong&gt; ] bones and sinews and [ &lt;strong&gt;Stage 4.2&lt;/strong&gt; ] hair, and also nails and hoofs and all similar parts; for this reason these are the last to assume their formation, for they have to wait till the time when nature has some residue to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the division of embryogenetic stages I proposed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stage 3&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Organs whose functions are vital activities and part of the end of the animal&amp;rsquo;s nature (e.g. the peripheral sense organs) are formed out of first nutriment, i.e. blood.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stage 4&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Organs whose functions are for the sake of vital activities but not part of the end of the animal&amp;rsquo;s nature are formed out of inferior nutriment:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.1:&lt;/strong&gt; Organs whose functions are for the sake of vital activities and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for the animal (e.g. bones, sinews) are made from the residues of Stage 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2:&lt;/strong&gt; Organs whose functions are for the sake of vital activities, but which are not necessary but &lt;em&gt;optimal&lt;/em&gt; for their performance (e.g. hair, nails, hooves) are made from whatever residue is left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the view I have defended, each stage of this process occurs when and in exactly the way it does as a result of the body plan instituted by the part of living thing that contains &amp;ldquo;the end of its nature&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s teleologically primary activity. This view is not shared by all interpreters&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
