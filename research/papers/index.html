<h3 id="perception-and-hypothetical-necessity-in-_posterior-analytics_-219">Perception and Hypothetical Necessity in <em>Posterior Analytics</em> 2.19</h3>
<p>In <em>Posterior Analytics</em> 2.19, Aristotle argues that knowledge of the first principles of a demonstrative science is acquired from the &ldquo;innate discriminative capacity&rdquo; we call <em>perception</em>. On a straightforward reading, his argument is conspicuously bad, failing specifically to rule out a rival innatist position that would have appeared viable both in his view and in that of his likely opponents. My aim in this paper is to show that Aristotle can be credited with a more satisfactory and, by his lights, cogent argument if we read it as an appeal to a distinctively natural scientific form of explanation, what Aristotle sometimes calls &ldquo;hypothetical necessity.&rdquo; In doing so, however, I argue that we must also come to see that Aristotle&rsquo;s conception of the role of perception in coming to know first principles is rooted in substantive and controversial psychological theses that find support, not in the foregoing chapters of the <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, but in natural scientific works like <em>De Anima</em> and the <em>Parva Naturalia</em>.</p>

<h3 id="revelation-and-reduction-in-aristotles-science-of-sensible-qualities">Revelation and Reduction in Aristotle&rsquo;s Science of Sensible Qualities</h3>
<!-- Aristotle's conception of color and other sensible qualities looks incongruous to modern readers, apparently embracing both the modern reductivist identification of these qualities to the physical causes of sense experience and the modern primitivist thesis that they essentially are how they are presented to us in the experiences they produce. Commentators, however, have struggled to understand how Aristotle manages to reconcile these claims within a single coherent theory. For some commentators, Aristotle regards sensible qualities as essentially characterized in terms of their psychological role as causes and manifest features of sense experience. For others, it is just the opposite: sensible qualities are defined rather by reference to perceiver-_independent_ physical properties.  -->
<!-- I diagnose this impasse as a failure by commentators to appreciate the explanatory sophistication of Aristotle's theory. On the reading I defend, Aristotle approaches sensible qualities as a subject of _scientific_ inquiry, an inquiry that seeks to explain the necessary features of sensible qualities in terms of their essential nature. In the context of this science, the psychological role of sensible qualities is not part of their essential nature, but rather a demonstrable _consequence_ of what they are essentially: namely, properties productive of perceiver-independent changes in their environment. Central to this explanatory project is a reductive account of sensible qualities, but unlike modern reductive theories, it is one that leaves intact the primitivist idea that experience "reveals" their essential nature. This feature of Aristotle's theory has been overlooked by interpreters, but as I argue, it is fundamental to Aristotle's conception of the value of the senses in promoting the practical and cognitive ends that structure animal life. -->
<p>Aristotle shares with modern physicalists the view that colors and other sensible qualities are identical to the properties that cause us to experience them. Unlike modern physicalists, however, Aristotle does not conclude from this that ordinary sense experience therefore cannot &ldquo;reveal&rdquo; to us what sensible qualities essentially are. In this paper, I propose to explain why. The reason, I contend, is not just that Aristotle’s physics is radically different from our own. To be sure, Aristotle does not see the same structural disanalogies between the world as we experience it and as it is described by fundamental physics, but for him too the identification of sensible qualities with the causes of sense experience is reductive, an attempt to explain sensible qualities in terms of more general&mdash;and scientifically sophisticated&mdash;causal connections. Nevertheless, for Aristotle the value of sense perception consists in its ability to make perceivers aware of the physical properties responsible for those experiences. In defending this view, I argue, Aristotle articulates a conception of perceptual knowledge that is both interesting in its own right and provides a novel justification for the intuitive thesis that experience of sensible qualities reveals, in some way or other, what those qualities essentially are.</p>

<h3 id="aristotle-on-why-the-senses-discriminate">Aristotle on Why the Senses Discriminate</h3>
<p>Aristotle regards the senses as &ldquo;discriminative&rdquo; (<em>kritikê</em>), capacities not only to be affected by and perceive sensible qualities, but also to &ldquo;discriminate and cognize something that is.&rdquo; Commentators since antiquity have tended to make two assumptions about the sensory capacity to discriminate: first that it is a capacity the senses have <em>essentially</em>, and second that its exercise results in a certain sort of <em>experience</em>, <em>e.g.</em> as of the difference between sensible qualities or their unity in a sensible body. I argue that both assumptions are mistaken. First, I argue that the capacity to discriminate is not essential but a scientifically knowable attribute of the senses, and that in <em>De Anima</em> Aristotle offers two arguments explaining why the senses discriminate, one final causal and one formal causal. Second, I argue that the capacity these arguments attribute to the senses is epistemically far richer than commentators have supposed: the capacity to become aware of the mind-independent features of sensible bodies.</p>

<!-- ### "Mixture and Motion": Aristotle on the Nature of Sensible Qualities -->
<!-- Aristotle identifies colors, sounds, flavors, and other sensible qualities with the physical properties that cause us to experience those qualities. However, unlike modern "physicalist" theories of sensible qualities, Aristotle does not draw a distinction between how we experience a quality and how that quality essentially is. I argue that this unique and puzzling feature of Aristotle's physicalism stems from a commitment to the view that a sensible quality is an abstract, mathematical form present in its actual as well as its potential instances, and I show that this view enables him to avoid some prominent objections to physicalist theories of sensible qualities. -->

<!-- ### Sensible Qualities, Sensible Objects, and Aristotle's Realism -->
<!-- Aristotle seems to think that objects for the most part have the colors, sounds, odors, and flavors we experience them as having, irrespective of whether they are experienced as having them. But for many commentators his commitment to this realist picture is importantly qualified. In their view, Aristotle concedes that colors, sounds, and other sensible qualities are _in actuality_ dependent on perceivers, so that a world without perceivers would be a world in which nothing is colored or sounding in the fullest sense. I argue that qualified realist views fail to distinguish two essentially distinct potentialities of material bodies, namely that which makes the body sensibly _qualified_ (colored or sounding) and that which makes it _sensible_ (visible or audible). Once we draw this distinction, we can see that Aristotle consistently---both in _De Anima_ and elsewhere---maintains an unqualified realism about sensible qualities, according to which a world without perceivers could be just as colorful, sonorous, and flavorful as ours is. -->

<h3 id="aristotle-on-the-end-of-an-organisms-nature">Aristotle on the End of an Organism&rsquo;s Nature</h3>
<p>In at least four passages of the corpus, Aristotle appeals to what we might term the &ldquo;natural end&rdquo; of an organism. The notion is evidently significant for Aristotle&rsquo;s approach to the life sciences, appearing decisively in explanations of phenomena such as animal perception and the observable order of embryonic development. However, both the notion and its explanatory role have been neglected in recent studies of Aristotle&rsquo;s natural teleology. This paper develops an interpretation of the natural end of an organism and its explanatory role in the Aristotelian life sciences, in an effort to prepare the way for a full appreciation of this important feature of Aristotle&rsquo;s natural teleology.</p>
<p>On the interpretation I defend, the natural end of an organism is the realization of the natural activity for whose sake that organism possesses and engages in each of the activities it is naturally capable of engaging in. So understood, the notion of an organism&rsquo;s natural end is bound intimately to a conception of organic life, and hence of the soul, as a complex of activities unified in the pursuit of a single, teleologically primary activity. This &ldquo;complex activity model&rdquo; of soul originates in <em>De Anima</em>, but its explanatory implications reach to Aristotle&rsquo;s account of organic development and morphology, accounting in particular for the developmental priority the parts of the animal body through the use of which the animal achieves the &ldquo;goal that is the function of its nature.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="material-nature-in-aristotles-_parts-of-animals_">Material Nature in Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Parts of Animals</em></h3>
<p>Biological kinds are thought to pose a special problem for Aristotle&rsquo;s approach to explanation. The problem is that some physiological attributes naturally belonging to living things seem not to be explained by their soul&mdash;their form and essence&mdash;but by their matter. I argue that the problem is only apparent, and that we can see the soul as the basis of even these explanations if we take into account Aristotle&rsquo;s claim in <em>Parts of Animals</em> 1.5 (645b28&ndash;646a2) that the organic parts of a living body stand in teleological relations that mirror those of the psychic activities for which they are instruments. On the basis of this claim, I argue that the soul accounts for a living thing&rsquo;s physiological attributes as both an efficient cause of its coming to be and the final cause of its being. I support this interpretation by showing that the parallel relations of teleological priority among psychic capacities and their material organs explain, first of all, the order in which the parts of the animal body are said to develop in <em>Generation of Animals</em>, and second, Aristotle&rsquo;s appeal to &ldquo;material nature&rdquo; in some controversial passages of <em>Parts of Animals</em>.</p>

<h3 id="hearing-speech-incidentally-an-aristotelian-distinction-concerning-perceptual-content">Hearing Speech Incidentally: An Aristotelian Distinction Concerning Perceptual Content</h3>
<p>There is a familiar difference between the experience of hearing a language one understands and the experience of hearing a language one doesn&rsquo;t understand. But theorists disagree on how this contrast is reflected in the <em>content</em> of these auditory experiences. Conservative approaches take the difference to concern non-semantic properties of the linguistic utterance, including low-level properties (such as pitch and timbre) as well as language-specific properties (such as being this or that phoneme). Liberal approaches, by contrast, take the difference also to concern whether the subject hears, or fails to hear, the <em>meaning</em> of the relevant utterance. I argue for a moderate approach, taking my point of departure from the Aristotelian idea that the meaning of a linguistic utterance is audible, but only &ldquo;incidentally&rdquo; so. I argue that this approach avoids the difficulties facing both the conservative and liberal approaches, and moreover provides a model for a broadly speaking Aristotelian theory of perceptual content that warrants serious consideration in its own right.</p>

<h3 id="aristotle-on-why-animals-have-_phantasia_">Aristotle on Why Animals Have <em>Phantasia</em></h3>
<p>Aristotle gives contradictory answers to the question whether all animals have <em>phantasia</em> (imagination). But while some commentators have claimed that Aristotle ultimately defends a positive or negative answer to the question, I argue that his ambivalence is well-motivated. Aristotle is pulled in different directions because he attributes two distinct roles to <em>phantasia</em>. In all animals it is responsible for the phenomenal character of experience, but it also serves as a representational faculty in the cognitively more sophisticated ones. I draw two morals from this conclusion: first, and against other recent interpretations, that <em>phantasia</em> is primarily the faculty responsible for providing the experiential, qualitative aspects of cognitive episodes; second, and more speculatively, that for Aristotle the representational content of an experience supervenes on its phenomenal character.</p>
