  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  This is a course about *appearances*, in particular, about *misleading*
  or *deceptive appearances*. In particular, we are interested in how
  deceptive appearances affect or inhibit our ability to learn about the
  world, and what we can do to respond to---or counteract---deceptive
  appearances.

  But what do we mean by /appearance/? This can be a difficult question to
  answer, since we might have in mind a number of things when we use the
  word "appearance". Think, for instance, of the various ways in which the
  English verb "appear" can be used:
  #+END_NOTES

** What Do We Mean By /Appearance/?

   If I say "/x/ appears to me...", I may mean:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
     1. that /x/ is present to me; before my eyes or mind; not hidden from view, as when I say
        : "That car just appeared right in front of me!"
     2. that /x/ looks to me a certain way, or has a certain outward "appearance", as when I say
        : "The Sun is much larger than it appears."
     3. /x/ seems to me to be a certain way, I believe (but do not /know/) that /x/ is a certain way, as when I say
        : "The restaurant appears to be closed."

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Which of these uses of "appear" should we have in mind for the purposes
   of this course? Which, in other words, captures the sense of appearance
   at issue when we worry about being misled by /deceptive/ appearances?
   The answer, as I hope you'll come to see, is (2), the sense of
   appearance that reflects the way thing /look/ to us, whether or not they
   really /are/ as they appear.

   To put the same point in a different way: we are interested in this
   sense of the word /appearance/ because it is in this sense that how
   things /appear/ contrasts with how they are /in reality/.

   Consider again the example sentence "the Sun is much larger than it appears":

   #+begin_notes
   Here we have a clear conflict between the appearance and the reality of
   the size of the Sun: from Earth, the Sun appears small---so small, in
   fact, that it can fit behind the Hagia Sophia---but in reality not only
   the Hagia Sophia but the entire planet could fit into the sun many
   hundreds of times over.

   This conflict between the appearance and reality of the size of the Sun
   provides a basic illustration of the potential conflicts between
   appearance and reality that we will be worrying about in this course. In
   general, the worry is this:
   #+end_notes


** Conflicts Between Appearance and Reality in General

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
       - We often make judgments about how things are in reality on the basis of how they appear to us.
       - Sometimes (let us suppose) things really are how they appear to us.
       - Other times, they are /not/ how they appear to us.

   #+REVEAL: split data-background-color="rgb(70, 70, 255)"

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    * Question 1 :: How does it happen that things appear to us otherwise than how they really are?
    * Question 2 :: Does the fact that things can appear otherwise than they are impair our efforts to learn about the world?
    * Question 3 :: If so, how can we avoid making false judgments when things are /not/ as they appear?

      #+begin_notes
      In general, these are the questions we will be asking continuously
      throughout the course.

      What counts as an "appearance" in this sense can be very broad,
      including within its scope even the ways in which scientific "facts" or
      stories purporting to be "news" are presented to observers and
      consumers. In due course we will consider these varieties of
      "appearance". But first, beginning with this Unit, we will start by
      considering the most basic and familiar type of appearance, what we
      might call *perceptual appearances*.

* Perceptual Appearance & Perceptual Experience
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: perceptual-appearance-perceptual-experience
  :END:

  #+begin_notes
  Let's begin by stating precisely what we mean by /perceptual appearance/.
  #+end_notes

** /Perceptual Appearance/ Defined

   /x/'s *perceptual appearance* is the way /x/ "looks",
   "feels", or otherwise outwardly appears to a perceiver, /e.g./:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
       - The sun looks to me to be the size of a 1 TL coin.
       - The table before me looks brown and rectangular.
       - The table before me feels solid and smooth.
       - The person shouting in the distance sounds angry.

   #+REVEAL: split data-background-color="rgb(70, 70, 255)"
   * Note :: The same object can perceptually appear in different and incompatible ways to different perceivers, or to the same perceiver at different times!

** Conflicts Between /Perceptual/ Appearance and Reality

   #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
       * We often make judgments about how things are in reality on the basis of how they appear to us in perception.
       * Sometimes, we assume, things really are how they perceptually appear to us.
       * Other times, they are /not/ how they appear to us.

   #+reveal: split data-background-color="rgb(255,255,70)"
   * Question 1 :: How does it happen that things appear to us _in
     perception_ otherwise than how they really are?

   #+begin_notes
   In the case of /perceptual/ appearances, this turns out to be a question
   about the nature of our perceptual experience, the way the world outside
   our skin is presented to us when we perceive it by means of our senses.

   Fortunately, philosophers have given us a vocabulary for talking and
   thinking about the varieties of perceptual experience. In general, we as
   perceivers are susceptible to three different types of perceptual
   experience. They break down as follows:
   #+end_notes

** Varieties of Perceptual Experience

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-up)
   If my perceptual experience corresponds to how things really are, my experience is *veridical*.
   
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-up)
   * Veridical Perception :: I perceive /o/ as being /F/, and /o/ really is /F/.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-up)
   But if my perceptual experience does /not/ correspond to how things
   really are, my experience is *non-veridical*.
   
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-up)
   * Non-Veridical Perception :: I perceive /o/ as being /F/, but:
     * /o/ is not really /F/, or
     * there is no /o/ I'm perceiving at all.

   #+begin_notes
   Notice, first of all, that there are two different ways for an
   experience to be non-veridical, /i.e./ to present a perceiver with an
   appearance that does not correspond to the way things really are.

   * In cases of *illusion*, a perceiver is aware of some object in the world, but she experiences it as having observable features or properties that it does not really have.

   * By contrast, in cases of *hallucination*, a perceiver is presented with an appearance of some object having certain observable features, but in reality there is no such object that she is perceiving at all.

   The phenomena of illusion and hallucination are what spell trouble for
   the idea that we can learn about the world on the basis of how it
   appears to us in perception. It'll be worthwhile, then, to consider some
   examples of illusion and hallucination, both to convince you that they
   really do happen---so we should be worried about them--- and so that we
   can begin to think about what makes them possible.
   #+end_notes

* Illusion
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: illusion
  :END:

  #+begin_notes
  We've already looked at one candidate for a perceptual illusion, namely:
  the size of the sun when viewed from Earth. Let's call this /Exhibit A/:
  #+end_notes

** Exhibit A: The Sun "Illusion"
   
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/sunistanbul.jpg">
   

   #+begin_notes
   A similar example is the famous "bent stick" illusion; let's call this
   /Exhibit B/:
   #+end_notes

** Exhibit B: The Bent-Stick "Illusion"
   
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/stickinwater.jpg">

   #+begin_notes
   Exhibit A and Exhibit B share a number of features:

   - First, they are both illusions of /perspective/: we see the sun as
     smaller than it is because we are far away from it; and we see the
     partially submerged stick as bent because we are viewing it through
     /mixed media/, partially through air and partially through water.

   - Second, and relatedly, there is something odd about making judgments
     about either the size of the sun of the curvature of the stick on the
     basis of these appearances.

     - Normally, we don't judge the size of something when we are so far
       away from it; rather try to get as close to it as we can.

     - Normally, we don't judge the curvature of something when it is
       partially submerged; rather, we wait until we can view it in a
       consistent medium.

   Indeed, most of us are not likely to judge on the basis of these
   appearances either that the Hagia Sophia is larger than the sun or that
   the partially-submerged stick is bent. You may even be inclined to say
   that, in these cases, the sun doesn't really "appear" to be smaller than
   the Hagia Sophia and the stick doesn't really "appear" to be bent; it is
   only that some people erroneously judge on the basis of these
   appearances that the sun is small and that the stick is bent.

   Which of course raises the question: how, if at all, can such
   experiences be considered non-veridical or illusory? Isn't it rather
   that the sun and the partially-submerged stick appear exactly as they
   should from the perspectives at which we are viewing them? Might we then
   say that the only error here is in making judgments about size or
   curvature in inappropriate circumstances?

   These are fair questions to ask about Exhibit A and Exhibit B. But they
   don't necessarily extend to all cases of misleading perceptual
   appearances.

   Consider now /Exhibit C/, the famous Müller-Lyer Illusion:
   #+end_notes

** Exhibit C: The Müller-Lyer Illusion

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/muller-lyer-illusion.jpg">
   
   #+begin_notes
   In this illusion, the horizontal lines appear to be different lengths,
   but in reality the lines are the same length. Now, if you've seen this
   illusion before, you likely haven't formed the judgment that the lines
   are the same in length. Nevertheless, it still /appears/ to you that the
   bottom line is longer than the top line. No matter whether you make or
   refrain from making the erroneous judgment, the non-veridical appearance
   remains.

   We can reproduce the same effects with other properties, including
   orientation and color.

   Consider /Exhibit D/: here the lines do not look to be parallel, though
   they are:
   #+end_notes

** Exhibit D: Parallel Line Illusion

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/parallel-lines.jpg">
   
   #+begin_notes
   (Easier to see that they are parallel if you look at the image
   sidelong.)

   We observe an even more striking instance of the same effect in /Exhibit
   E/, what has come to be known as the checker shadow illusion.
   #+end_notes

** Exhibit E: The Checker Shadow Illusion

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/Checker_shadow_illusion.svg">

   
   #+begin_notes
   To see what's going on here, ask yourself whether the square marked A is
   the same color as the square marked B. You're probably inclined to say
   "no", but if so you're wrong: squares A and B are in fact the same
   color! (You can check this yourself by covering up everything around B.)
   Here, as in Exhibits C and D, the non-veridical appearance persists even
   after you learn the truth. Here too, then, our experience seems to
   present us with an object as possessing properties it does not really
   have.
   #+end_notes

   #+reveal: split data-background-color="rgb(255,255,70)"

   * Question :: Don't believe me? Check out the [[https://www.illusionsindex.org/ir/checkershadow][Illusions Index]]!

   #+reveal_html: <iframe class="r-stretch" data-src="https://www.illusionsindex.org/ir/checkershadow" data-preload></iframe>

   #+begin_notes
   What's going on in cases like these? To be sure, both cases are
   specially designed by psychologists to isolate and manipulate ways in
   which the brain processes sensory stimuli. In the checker shadow
   illusion, for instance, what is being manipulated is the brain's ability
   to maintain *color constancy* under different lighting conditions
   (what's key to the illusion is that B is in what the brain interprets as
   a "shadow" cast by the green cylinder.)

   However, these neural processes are not just active in these
   experimental conditions; they are a fundamental part of the processes
   whereby our brain generates ordinary perceptual experience from sensory
   stimuli. So what happens in these cases can and does happen in ordinary,
   non-experimental conditions. The lesson is that we may be, and almost
   certainly are, subject to non-veridical experience---deceptive
   appearances---on a regular basis. Which raises the question: how can
   perception teach us about the world, if for all we know we may be
   subject to an illusion?
   #+end_notes

* Hallucination
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hallucination
  :END:

  #+begin_notes
  This lesson is even more forceful in the case of the second type of
  non-veridical perceptual experience, hallucination.

  Recall that, in hallucinations, perceivers have the experience of there
  being some object with certain observable features, but in reality no
  such object exists---or, at least, no such object exists when and where
  the perceiver experiences it.

  Now, you may wonder whether experiences of that sort ever really occur.
  To be sure, they are often dramatized in film and literature, as in
  Shakespeare's /MacBeth/, when MacBeth, in a fit of madness, claims to
  see a dagger before him, though he cannot clutch it, since it isn't
  really there. We can call this /Exhibit F/:
  #+end_notes

** Exhibit F: MacBeth's Dagger

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/macbethdagger.jpg">
   
   #+begin_notes
   You've probably also heard it said that schizophrenia patients "hear
   voices", where what is meant by that is that they have auditory
   experiences /as if/ they were hearing another person speak, when in fact
   no such person is speaking to them. But do such cases of hallucination
   ever happen to normally functioning perceivers?

   Whether or not hallucination is common among normally functioning
   perceivers, it is certainly a possibility, and in some cases the
   phenomenon is well-documented.

   Consider, for instance, /Exhibit G/, the phenomenon often called
   "phantom limb pain":
   #+end_notes

** Exhibit G: Phantom Limb Pain

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/phantomlimb.jpg">
   
   #+begin_notes
   Phantom limb pain is an experience, reported by amputees, in which
   patients experience pain, or an itch, or a tickle, in a part of their
   body that has been amputated. Often the experience is excruciating, and
   can only be addressed by a doctor's setting up a system of mirrors so
   that the patient sees e.g. her other hand as though it were the missing
   hand, which the doctor then soothes or scratches as necessary.

   Phantom limb patients do not have neurological damage. Rather, they
   experience discomfort as originating from a now-lost limb because of
   activity in parts of the brain that had been active when that limb (when
   intact) itched or felt pain.

   The phenomenon of phantom limb pain shows just how easy it can be for
   hallucinations to happen:

   - Apparently, stimulating parts of the brain that are ordinarily
     involved in a certain sort of experience---say a tickle or a twinge of
     pain in my left arm---can create experiences of that kind even when
     the appropriate stimulus, i.e. something that tickles or causes pain.

   - But if so, then hallucination does not seem to be limited to amputees:
     stimulating parts of my brain involved in experiences, say, of round
     red objects could cause me to have an experience as of a red balloon,
     /even if there is no red balloon before me/.

   - It is even conceivable that for regions of my brain involved in
     perceptual experience might be /systematically stimulated/ in such a
     way that I have an experience that feels entirely veridical, but
     corresponds in no way whatsoever to what's going on in my environment.

   This line of thought raises the alarming possibility of *total
   hallucination*:
   #+end_notes

** Total Hallucination

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="r-stretch" src="./images/braininvat.jpg">

   * Total Hallucination :: An experience in which /nothing/ in a perceiver's experience corresponds to the reality of her perceptual environment.

   #+begin_notes
   The conceivabiliy of total hallucination has given rise to several
   philosophical fantasies in which a persons entire life has been a
   hallucination, some of which you're probably familiar with:

   - What if my life has all been a dream?

   - What if I am in the Matrix?

   - What if I am a brain in a vat, and my experiences are nothing but the
     result of stimulations of my brain by evil scientists?

   Our aim in considering perceptual appearances is not to settle whether
   any of these scenarios is true, or even possible. The question we want
   to pursue is rather this: if, for all we know, the way things
   perceptually appear to us corresponds in no way to the way the world
   really is, how can we use our senses to learn about the world?

      basis of illusory or hallucinatory perceptual experiences_?

* Preview: Perception and Empirical Knowledge
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: perception-and-empirical-knowledge
  :END:

  #+begin_notes
  We have been talking about the varieties of perceptual experience---in
  other words, the different ways in which the world can appear to us as
  perceivers. In general, we said that an experience can be either
  *veridical* or *non-veridical*, and if an experience non-veridical, it
  may be so by being either *illusory* or *hallucinatory*.

  We also looked at several examples of both illusion and hallucination,
  for two reasons: first, to illustrate the evident fact that the
  appearances we are presented with in perception are not always
  veridical, i.e. do not always fully correspond to reality; and second,
  to get a preliminary and intuitive sense of the challenge posed by
  non-veridical perceptual appearances for the idea that we can learn
  about the world by perceiving it.

  In summary, then, we're ready to raise the second of the three questions
  we wish to raise about perceptual appearances:
  #+end_notes

** So Far

   We've seen that...

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in-then-semi-out) 
    * Perception can be either veridical or non-veridical, and if non-veridical, then either illusory or hallucinatory.
    * Intuitively, if a perceptual appearance is non-veridical, then it
      gives us no basis for judging that the world is as it appears to the
      perceiver.
    * It is not always obvious whether a perceptual appearance is veridical,
      illusory, or hallucinatory.

   #+REVEAL: split data-background-color="rgb(47,255,171)" 
   Which raises the question:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in) 
    * Question 2 :: Does the fact that we are susceptible to illusion and
     hallucination hamper our efforts to learn about the world _by means of
     our senses_?

    * In other words... :: Is it possible to acquire *empirical knowledge* if
      we are subject to illusion and hallucination?

   #+begin_notes
   In putting Question 2 in terms of empirical knowledge, we are drawing
   yet again on a philosophical vocabulary for describing the ways in which
   we come to know about the world. So it will be worthwhile to pause for a
   moment and consider what philosophers mean when they talk about
   /empirical/ knowledge.

   Put simply, empirical knowledge is knowledge based upon the evidence of
   the senses. To see what makes this kind of knowledge special, let's look
   at one traditional and widespread theory of what it takes to /know/ that
   something is the case. This is the so-called *classical theory of
   knowledge* discussed by philosophers working in the field of
   *epistemology*, the philosophical discipline dedicated to the study of
   knowledge.
   #+end_notes
   
** Knowledge in General

   #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
    * Epistemology :: The philosophical discipline devoted to the study of
     knowledge.

   #+REVEAL: split data-background-color="rgb(47,255,171)" 
    * The Classical Theory of Knowledge :: To have knowledge of some fact,
      e.g.:
      : that the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees
      : that Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey,
      a person must meet 3 conditions:

   #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
        * Belief :: She must (be prepared to) *accept the fact as true*.
        * Truth :: The fact must really be *true*; and
        * Justification :: She must have *good reasons* for accepting it as
          true.

   #+begin_notes
   According to the classical theory, the Belief and Truth conditions are
   common to all forms of knowledge. But forms of knowledge can differ on
   the source and character of their /justification/, /i.e./ on the types
   of reasons supporting or justifying knowledge of different types of fact
   or proposition.

   /Empirical/ knowledge is special because its justification derives from
   sense experience:
   #+end_notes

** What is /Empirical/ Knowledge?

 * Empirical Knowledge :: Knowledge whose *justification* derives from perceptual experience, including:
   * knowledge of the external world
   * knowledge of one's own body

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 * Contrast knowledge of mathematical or conceptual truths, /e.g./:
   * knowledge that triangles have interior angles summing to 180^o
   * knowledge that scarlet is a shade of red

#+REVEAL: split data-background-color="rgb(70, 70, 255)"
 * The Difference? :: Knowledge of mathematical or conceptual truths /cannot/ be justified on the basis of perceptual experience!

#+begin_notes
It may at first glance be hard to see the difference between knowledge
of mathematical and conceptual truths and what we're calling "empirical
knowledge". Isn't it obvious, for instance, that we rely on our senses
to acquire the concept of scarlet in the first place? Most of us relied
on our color vision when we first acquired the concept; but even a
colorblind person, who of course could acquire the concept of scarlet
and come to know that scarlet is a shade of red, would nevertheless have
to rely on her senses. For she'd have to read about it somewhere, or
else have the concept explained to her, and both of these activities
necessarily involve the senses. Isn't this knowledge too therefore based
on, or justified by, sense perception?

This may be a tempting line of thought, but it misconstrues what
epistemologists mean by /justification/:

In saying that knowledge of the external world or of one's own body is
/justified/ by perceptual experience, whereas knowledge of mathematical
and conceptual truths are not, we are /not/ denying a role to the senses
in acquiring some or even all of our concepts. /Rather/, we are claiming
that our knowledge of truths about the external world and about our own
bodies relies on reasons---or, better yet, /evidence/---from perceptual
experience in a way that our knowledge mathematical and conceptual
truths does not:

   - if I know that the wood trim of the table before me is brown, or that
     I have two hands, it is /because/ I have seen the table and its color,
     or observed (by vision or proprioception) both of my hands.

   - by contrast, if I know that all triangles have interior angles
     equaling 180^o, it /not/ because I have measured a bunch of
     triangles and seen that the interior angles of each sums to
     180^o. Rather, it because I understand that having interior
     angles equaling 180$^{\text{o}}$ is a consequence of what a triangle
     is, namely a three-sided plane figure.

It is this special /justificatory/ relationship between perceptual
experience and empirical knowledge that we are calling attention to by
raising Question 2. How can my experience of the world being such and
such a way---being such that the table before me is rectangular and has
brown trim---in any way /justify/ my belief that it really /is/ that
way, given that, for all I know, my experience may be an illusion, or
even a hallucination?

To give a negative answer to this question would be to say that the
possibility of illusion and hallucination mean that perception gives us
no reason for believing the world really /is/ as it /appears/. We can
call this the *skeptical conclusion*:

 * Question 2 :: Does the fact that we are susceptible to illusion and
   hallucination hamper our efforts to learn about the world by means of
   our senses?

 * Skeptical Conclusion :: Yes! It shows that perceptual experiences
     /cannot/ justify beliefs about the world.

But why /that/ name?

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 * Skepticism :: The view that knowledge, or knowledge of some type, is
     impossible.
 * Skepticism About Empirical Knowledge :: The view that empirical
     knowledge is impossible.

Why should we be compelled to the Skeptical Conclusion? On it's face,
the argument is simple:

** An Argument for the Skeptical Conclusion
#+attr_reveal: :frag (fade-in-then-semi-out)
 * *Premise 1.* Empirical knowledge concerns what is /in fact/ the case, e.g. whether
     /o/ is in fact /F/.

 * *Premise 2.* Perception tells us only what /appears/ to be the case, e.g. whether
     /o/ appears to be /F/.

 * *Premise 3.* It is not the case that: if /o/ appears to be /F/, then /o/ is in fact
     /F/.

 * *Conclusion.* /So/, empirical knowledge cannot be derived from perceptual
     experience.

#+begin_notes
But this seemingly simple argument in fact raises a difficulty question
about the nature of perceptual appearances:

   - According to Premise 2, perception tells us only what /appears/ to be the
     case.

   - If this is right, then there does not seem to be a straightforward
     connection between what something we perceive is /like/ and how it
     /appears/ to us when we perceive it.

   - Question :: How is such a discrepancy between appearance and reality
     /possible/?

This is a point well made by the 20th Century British philosopher
Bertrand Russell, who argues that the discrepancy between appearance and
reality can only be explained if we concede that what we are /directly/
aware of when we perceive are not things in the world, but products of
our own minds---items that Russell calls *sense-data*.

** Russell on Appearance and Reality

[I]f we take any common object of the sort that is supposed to be known
by the senses, what the senses /immediately/ tell us is not the truth
about the object as it is apart from us, but only the truth about
certain sense-data which, so far as we can see, depend upon the
relations between us and the object...
#+reveal: split
Thus what we directly see and
feel is merely "appearance," which we believe to be a sign of some
"reality" behind. But if the reality is not what appears, have we any
means of knowing whether there is any reality at all ? And if so, have
we any means of finding out what it is like? (23)
  
#+begin_notes
As Russell notes, how we answer our question whether perceptual
appearances can /justify/ beliefs about what empirical reality is like
depends on how we think perceptual appearances relate to the reality
that we think gives rise to them.

This will be our topic in the next unit, when we will consider in detail
two ways of thinking about how appearances connect to reality, theories
that have come to be known by the names of *Direct* and *Indirect
Realism*.

** Where We Go From Here

Units 1--2 explore Question 2 (and the Skeptical Conclusion) from two different perspectives:

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 * Unit 1.2--3 :: What does the science of illusion and hallucination tell us about our access to reality?
 * Unit 2 :: What /theory/ of perceptual experience best accounts for the empirical evidence?
