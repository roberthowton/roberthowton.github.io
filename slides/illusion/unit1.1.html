This is a course about <b>appearances</b>, in particular, about <b>misleading</b>
or <b>deceptive appearances</b>. In particular, we are interested in how
deceptive appearances affect or inhibit our ability to learn about the
world, and what we can do to respond to&#x2014;or counteract&#x2014;deceptive
appearances.
</p>

<p>
But what do we mean by <i>appearance</i>? This can be a difficult question to
answer, since we might have in mind a number of things when we use the
word &ldquo;appearance&rdquo;. Think, for instance, of the various ways in which the
English verb &ldquo;appear&rdquo; can be used:
</p>

<h3 id="org9176100">What Do We Mean By <i>Appearance</i>?</h3>
<p>
If I say &ldquo;<i>x</i> appears to me&#x2026;&rdquo;, I may mean:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
that <i>x</i> is present to me; before my eyes or mind; not hidden from view, as when I say
</p>
<pre class="example">
"That car just appeared right in front of me!"
</pre></li>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
that <i>x</i> looks to me a certain way, or has a certain outward &ldquo;appearance&rdquo;, as when I say
</p>
<pre class="example">
"The Sun is much larger than it appears."
</pre></li>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
<i>x</i> seems to me to be a certain way, I believe (but do not <i>know</i>) that <i>x</i> is a certain way, as when I say

"The restaurant appears to be closed."
</pre></li>

</ol>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Which of these uses of &ldquo;appear&rdquo; should we have in mind for the purposes
of this course? Which, in other words, captures the sense of appearance
at issue when we worry about being misled by <i>deceptive</i> appearances?
The answer, as I hope you&rsquo;ll come to see, is (2), the sense of
appearance that reflects the way thing <i>look</i> to us, whether or not they
really <i>are</i> as they appear.
</p>

<p>
To put the same point in a different way: we are interested in this
sense of the word <i>appearance</i> because it is in this sense that how
things <i>appear</i> contrasts with how they are <i>in reality</i>.
</p>

<p>
Consider again the example sentence &ldquo;the Sun is much larger than it appears&rdquo;:

Here we have a clear conflict between the appearance and the reality of
the size of the Sun: from Earth, the Sun appears small&#x2014;so small, in
fact, that it can fit behind the Hagia Sophia&#x2014;but in reality not only
the Hagia Sophia but the entire planet could fit into the sun many
hundreds of times over.
</p>

<p>
This conflict between the appearance and reality of the size of the Sun
provides a basic illustration of the potential conflicts between
appearance and reality that we will be worrying about in this course. In
general, the worry is this:

What counts as an &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; in this sense can be very broad,
including within its scope even the ways in which scientific &ldquo;facts&rdquo; or
stories purporting to be &ldquo;news&rdquo; are presented to observers and
consumers. In due course we will consider these varieties of
&ldquo;appearance&rdquo;. But first, beginning with this Unit, we will start by
considering the most basic and familiar type of appearance, what we
might call <b>perceptual appearances</b>.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
In the case of <i>perceptual</i> appearances, this turns out to be a question
about the nature of our perceptual experience, the way the world outside
our skin is presented to us when we perceive it by means of our senses.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, philosophers have given us a vocabulary for talking and
thinking about the varieties of perceptual experience. In general, we as
perceivers are susceptible to three different types of perceptual
experience. They break down as follows:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgee3ffc2">
<h3 id="orgee3ffc2">Varieties of Perceptual Experience</h3>
<p class="fragment (fade-up)">
If my perceptual experience corresponds to how things really are, my experience is <b>veridical</b>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt class="fragment fade-up">Veridical Perception</dt><dd class="fragment fade-up">I perceive <i>o</i> as being <i>F</i>, and <i>o</i> really is <i>F</i>.</dd>

</dl>

<p class="fragment (fade-up)">
But if my perceptual experience does <i>not</i> correspond to how things
really are, my experience is <b>non-veridical</b>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt class="fragment fade-up">Non-Veridical Perception</dt><dd class="fragment fade-up">I perceive <i>o</i> as being <i>F</i>, but:
<ul>
<li><i>o</i> is not really <i>F</i>, or</li>
<li>there is no <i>o</i> I&rsquo;m perceiving at all.</li>

</ul></dd>

</dl>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Notice, first of all, that there are two different ways for an
experience to be non-veridical, <i>i.e.</i> to present a perceiver with an
appearance that does not correspond to the way things really are.
</p>

<ul>
<li>In cases of <b>illusion</b>, a perceiver is aware of some object in the world, but she experiences it as having observable features or properties that it does not really have.</li>

<li>By contrast, in cases of <b>hallucination</b>, a perceiver is presented with an appearance of some object having certain observable features, but in reality there is no such object that she is perceiving at all.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The phenomena of illusion and hallucination are what spell trouble for
the idea that we can learn about the world on the basis of how it
appears to us in perception. It&rsquo;ll be worthwhile, then, to consider some
examples of illusion and hallucination, both to convince you that they
really do happen&#x2014;so we should be worried about them&#x2014; and so that we
can begin to think about what makes them possible.
</p>

<section>
<section id="slide-illusion">
<h2 id="illusion">Illusion</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We&rsquo;ve already looked at one candidate for a perceptual illusion, namely:
the size of the sun when viewed from Earth. Let&rsquo;s call this <i>Exhibit A</i>:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-org5440ec4">
<h3 id="org5440ec4">Exhibit A: The Sun &ldquo;Illusion&rdquo;</h3>
<img class="r-stretch" src="./images/sunistanbul.jpg">


<aside class="notes">
<p>
A similar example is the famous &ldquo;bent stick&rdquo; illusion; let&rsquo;s call this
<i>Exhibit B</i>:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-org6529b1b">
<h3 id="org6529b1b">Exhibit B: The Bent-Stick &ldquo;Illusion&rdquo;</h3>
<img class="r-stretch" src="./images/stickinwater.jpg">

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Exhibit A and Exhibit B share a number of features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>First, they are both illusions of <i>perspective</i>: we see the sun as
smaller than it is because we are far away from it; and we see the
partially submerged stick as bent because we are viewing it through
<i>mixed media</i>, partially through air and partially through water.</li>

<li>Second, and relatedly, there is something odd about making judgments
about either the size of the sun of the curvature of the stick on the
basis of these appearances.

<ul>
<li>Normally, we don&rsquo;t judge the size of something when we are so far
away from it; rather try to get as close to it as we can.</li>

<li>Normally, we don&rsquo;t judge the curvature of something when it is
partially submerged; rather, we wait until we can view it in a
consistent medium.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>
Indeed, most of us are not likely to judge on the basis of these
appearances either that the Hagia Sophia is larger than the sun or that
the partially-submerged stick is bent. You may even be inclined to say
that, in these cases, the sun doesn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;appear&rdquo; to be smaller than
the Hagia Sophia and the stick doesn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;appear&rdquo; to be bent; it is
only that some people erroneously judge on the basis of these
appearances that the sun is small and that the stick is bent.
</p>

<p>
Which of course raises the question: how, if at all, can such
experiences be considered non-veridical or illusory? Isn&rsquo;t it rather
that the sun and the partially-submerged stick appear exactly as they
should from the perspectives at which we are viewing them? Might we then
say that the only error here is in making judgments about size or
curvature in inappropriate circumstances?
</p>

<p>
These are fair questions to ask about Exhibit A and Exhibit B. But they
don&rsquo;t necessarily extend to all cases of misleading perceptual
appearances.
</p>

<p>
Consider now <i>Exhibit C</i>, the famous Müller-Lyer Illusion:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgbf5febc">
<h3 id="orgbf5febc">Exhibit C: The Müller-Lyer Illusion</h3>
<img class="r-stretch" src="./images/muller-lyer-illusion.jpg">

<aside class="notes">
<p>
In this illusion, the horizontal lines appear to be different lengths,
but in reality the lines are the same length. Now, if you&rsquo;ve seen this
illusion before, you likely haven&rsquo;t formed the judgment that the lines
are the same in length. Nevertheless, it still <i>appears</i> to you that the
bottom line is longer than the top line. No matter whether you make or
refrain from making the erroneous judgment, the non-veridical appearance
remains.
</p>

<p>
We can reproduce the same effects with other properties, including
orientation and color.
</p>

<p>
Consider <i>Exhibit D</i>: here the lines do not look to be parallel, though
they are:
</p>

</aside>

<h3 id="org4f23cf4">Exhibit D: Parallel Line Illusion</h3>
<img class="r-stretch" src="./images/parallel-lines.jpg">

<aside class="notes">
<p>
(Easier to see that they are parallel if you look at the image
sidelong.)
</p>

<p>
We observe an even more striking instance of the same effect in <i>Exhibit
E</i>, what has come to be known as the checker shadow illusion.
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-org949b4a9">
<h3 id="org949b4a9">Exhibit E: The Checker Shadow Illusion</h3>
<img class="r-stretch" src="./images/Checker_shadow_illusion.svg">


<aside class="notes">
<p>
To see what&rsquo;s going on here, ask yourself whether the square marked A is
the same color as the square marked B. You&rsquo;re probably inclined to say
&ldquo;no&rdquo;, but if so you&rsquo;re wrong: squares A and B are in fact the same
color! (You can check this yourself by covering up everything around B.)
Here, as in Exhibits C and D, the non-veridical appearance persists even
after you learn the truth. Here too, then, our experience seems to
present us with an object as possessing properties it does not really
have.
</p>

</aside>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
What&rsquo;s going on in cases like these? To be sure, both cases are
specially designed by psychologists to isolate and manipulate ways in
which the brain processes sensory stimuli. In the checker shadow
illusion, for instance, what is being manipulated is the brain&rsquo;s ability
to maintain <b>color constancy</b> under different lighting conditions
(what&rsquo;s key to the illusion is that B is in what the brain interprets as
a &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; cast by the green cylinder.)
</p>

<p>
However, these neural processes are not just active in these
experimental conditions; they are a fundamental part of the processes
whereby our brain generates ordinary perceptual experience from sensory
stimuli. So what happens in these cases can and does happen in ordinary,
non-experimental conditions. The lesson is that we may be, and almost
certainly are, subject to non-veridical experience&#x2014;deceptive
appearances&#x2014;on a regular basis. Which raises the question: how can
perception teach us about the world, if for all we know we may be
subject to an illusion?

<section id="slide-hallucination">
<h2 id="hallucination">Hallucination</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
This lesson is even more forceful in the case of the second type of
non-veridical perceptual experience, hallucination.
</p>

<p>
Recall that, in hallucinations, perceivers have the experience of there
being some object with certain observable features, but in reality no
such object exists&#x2014;or, at least, no such object exists when and where
the perceiver experiences it.
</p>

<p>
Now, you may wonder whether experiences of that sort ever really occur.
To be sure, they are often dramatized in film and literature, as in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>MacBeth</i>, when MacBeth, in a fit of madness, claims to
see a dagger before him, though he cannot clutch it, since it isn&rsquo;t
really there. We can call this <i>Exhibit F</i>:
</p>

You&rsquo;ve probably also heard it said that schizophrenia patients &ldquo;hear
voices&rdquo;, where what is meant by that is that they have auditory
experiences <i>as if</i> they were hearing another person speak, when in fact
no such person is speaking to them. But do such cases of hallucination
ever happen to normally functioning perceivers?
</p>

<p>
Whether or not hallucination is common among normally functioning
perceivers, it is certainly a possibility, and in some cases the
phenomenon is well-documented.
</p>

<p>
Consider, for instance, <i>Exhibit G</i>, the phenomenon often called
&ldquo;phantom limb pain&rdquo;:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-org51f870d">
<h3 id="org51f870d">Exhibit G: Phantom Limb Pain</h3>
<img class="r-stretch" src="./images/phantomlimb.jpg">

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Phantom limb pain is an experience, reported by amputees, in which
patients experience pain, or an itch, or a tickle, in a part of their
body that has been amputated. Often the experience is excruciating, and
can only be addressed by a doctor&rsquo;s setting up a system of mirrors so
that the patient sees e.g. her other hand as though it were the missing
hand, which the doctor then soothes or scratches as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Phantom limb patients do not have neurological damage. Rather, they
experience discomfort as originating from a now-lost limb because of
activity in parts of the brain that had been active when that limb (when
intact) itched or felt pain.
</p>

<p>
The phenomenon of phantom limb pain shows just how easy it can be for
hallucinations to happen:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Apparently, stimulating parts of the brain that are ordinarily
involved in a certain sort of experience&#x2014;say a tickle or a twinge of
pain in my left arm&#x2014;can create experiences of that kind even when
the appropriate stimulus, i.e. something that tickles or causes pain.</li>

<li>But if so, then hallucination does not seem to be limited to amputees:
stimulating parts of my brain involved in experiences, say, of round
red objects could cause me to have an experience as of a red balloon,
<i>even if there is no red balloon before me</i>.</li>

<li>It is even conceivable that for regions of my brain involved in
perceptual experience might be <i>systematically stimulated</i> in such a
way that I have an experience that feels entirely veridical, but
corresponds in no way whatsoever to what&rsquo;s going on in my environment.</li>

</ul>

<p>
This line of thought raises the alarming possibility of <b>total
hallucination</b>:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-org23ba225">
<h3 id="org23ba225">Total Hallucination</h3>
<img class="r-stretch" src="./images/braininvat.jpg">

<dl>
<dt>Total Hallucination</dt><dd>An experience in which <i>nothing</i> in a perceiver&rsquo;s experience corresponds to the reality of her perceptual environment.</dd>

</dl>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The conceivabiliy of total hallucination has given rise to several
philosophical fantasies in which a persons entire life has been a
hallucination, some of which you&rsquo;re probably familiar with:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What if my life has all been a dream?</li>

<li>What if I am in the Matrix?</li>

<li>What if I am a brain in a vat, and my experiences are nothing but the
result of stimulations of my brain by evil scientists?</li>

</ul>

<p>
Our aim in considering perceptual appearances is not to settle whether
any of these scenarios is true, or even possible. The question we want
to pursue is rather this: if, for all we know, the way things
perceptually appear to us corresponds in no way to the way the world
really is, how can we use our senses to learn about the world?

<p>
We have been talking about the varieties of perceptual experience&#x2014;in
other words, the different ways in which the world can appear to us as
perceivers. In general, we said that an experience can be either
<b>veridical</b> or <b>non-veridical</b>, and if an experience non-veridical, it
may be so by being either <b>illusory</b> or <b>hallucinatory</b>.
</p>

<p>
We also looked at several examples of both illusion and hallucination,
for two reasons: first, to illustrate the evident fact that the
appearances we are presented with in perception are not always
veridical, i.e. do not always fully correspond to reality; and second,
to get a preliminary and intuitive sense of the challenge posed by
non-veridical perceptual appearances for the idea that we can learn
about the world by perceiving it.
</p>

<p>
In summary, then, we&rsquo;re ready to raise the second of the three questions

<aside class="notes">
<p>
In putting Question 2 in terms of empirical knowledge, we are drawing
yet again on a philosophical vocabulary for describing the ways in which
we come to know about the world. So it will be worthwhile to pause for a
moment and consider what philosophers mean when they talk about
<i>empirical</i> knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Put simply, empirical knowledge is knowledge based upon the evidence of
the senses. To see what makes this kind of knowledge special, let&rsquo;s look
at one traditional and widespread theory of what it takes to <i>know</i> that
something is the case. This is the so-called <b>classical theory of
knowledge</b> discussed by philosophers working in the field of
<b>epistemology</b>, the philosophical discipline dedicated to the study of
knowledge.

<dt>The Classical Theory of Knowledge</dt><dd><p>
To have knowledge of some fact,
e.g.:
</p>
<pre class="example">
that the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees
that Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey,
</pre>

<p>
a person must meet 3 conditions:

<p>
According to the classical theory, the Belief and Truth conditions are
common to all forms of knowledge. But forms of knowledge can differ on
the source and character of their <i>justification</i>, <i>i.e.</i> on the types
of reasons supporting or justifying knowledge of different types of fact
or proposition.
</p>

<p>
<i>Empirical</i> knowledge is special because its justification derives from
sense experience:

<dt>The Difference?</dt><dd>Knowledge of mathematical or conceptual truths <i>cannot</i> be justified on the basis of perceptual experience!</dd>

</dl>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
It may at first glance be hard to see the difference between knowledge
of mathematical and conceptual truths and what we&rsquo;re calling &ldquo;empirical
knowledge&rdquo;. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious, for instance, that we rely on our senses
to acquire the concept of scarlet in the first place? Most of us relied
on our color vision when we first acquired the concept; but even a
colorblind person, who of course could acquire the concept of scarlet
and come to know that scarlet is a shade of red, would nevertheless have
to rely on her senses. For she&rsquo;d have to read about it somewhere, or
else have the concept explained to her, and both of these activities
necessarily involve the senses. Isn&rsquo;t this knowledge too therefore based
on, or justified by, sense perception?
</p>

<p>
This may be a tempting line of thought, but it misconstrues what
epistemologists mean by <i>justification</i>:
</p>

<p>
In saying that knowledge of the external world or of one&rsquo;s own body is
<i>justified</i> by perceptual experience, whereas knowledge of mathematical
and conceptual truths are not, we are <i>not</i> denying a role to the senses
in acquiring some or even all of our concepts. <i>Rather</i>, we are claiming
that our knowledge of truths about the external world and about our own
bodies relies on reasons&#x2014;or, better yet, <i>evidence</i>&#x2014;from perceptual
experience in a way that our knowledge mathematical and conceptual
truths does not:
</p>

<ul>
<li>if I know that the wood trim of the table before me is brown, or that
I have two hands, it is <i>because</i> I have seen the table and its color,
or observed (by vision or proprioception) both of my hands.</li>

<li>by contrast, if I know that all triangles have interior angles
equaling 180<sup>o</sup>, it <i>not</i> because I have measured a bunch of
triangles and seen that the interior angles of each sums to
180<sup>o</sup>. Rather, it because I understand that having interior
angles equaling 180\(^{\text{o}}\) is a consequence of what a triangle
is, namely a three-sided plane figure.</li>

</ul>

<p>
It is this special <i>justificatory</i> relationship between perceptual
experience and empirical knowledge that we are calling attention to by
raising Question 2. How can my experience of the world being such and
such a way&#x2014;being such that the table before me is rectangular and has
brown trim&#x2014;in any way <i>justify</i> my belief that it really <i>is</i> that
way, given that, for all I know, my experience may be an illusion, or
even a hallucination?
</p>

<p>
To give a negative answer to this question would be to say that the
possibility of illusion and hallucination mean that perception gives us
no reason for believing the world really <i>is</i> as it <i>appears</i>. We can
call this the <b>skeptical conclusion</b>:

<p>
Why should we be compelled to the Skeptical Conclusion? On it&rsquo;s face,
the argument is simple:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgb0af4f0">
<h3 id="orgb0af4f0">An Argument for the Skeptical Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"><b>Premise 1.</b> Empirical knowledge concerns what is <i>in fact</i> the case, e.g. whether
<i>o</i> is in fact <i>F</i>.</li>

<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"><b>Premise 2.</b> Perception tells us only what <i>appears</i> to be the case, e.g. whether
<i>o</i> appears to be <i>F</i>.</li>

<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"><b>Premise 3.</b> It is not the case that: if <i>o</i> appears to be <i>F</i>, then <i>o</i> is in fact
<i>F</i>.</li>

<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"><b>Conclusion.</b> <i>So</i>, empirical knowledge cannot be derived from perceptual
experience.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
But this seemingly simple argument in fact raises a difficulty question
about the nature of perceptual appearances:
</p>

<ul>
<li>According to Premise 2, perception tells us only what <i>appears</i> to be the
case.</li>

<li>If this is right, then there does not seem to be a straightforward
connection between what something we perceive is <i>like</i> and how it
<i>appears</i> to us when we perceive it.</li>

<li id="Question">How is such a discrepancy between appearance and reality
<i>possible</i>?</li>

</ul>

<p>
This is a point well made by the 20th Century British philosopher
Bertrand Russell, who argues that the discrepancy between appearance and
reality can only be explained if we concede that what we are <i>directly</i>
aware of when we perceive are not things in the world, but products of
our own minds&#x2014;items that Russell calls <b>sense-data</b>.
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgc11d2f1">
<h3 id="orgc11d2f1">Russell on Appearance and Reality</h3>
<p>
[I]f we take any common object of the sort that is supposed to be known
by the senses, what the senses <i>immediately</i> tell us is not the truth
about the object as it is apart from us, but only the truth about
certain sense-data which, so far as we can see, depend upon the
relations between us and the object&#x2026;
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Thus what we directly see and
feel is merely &ldquo;appearance,&rdquo; which we believe to be a sign of some
&ldquo;reality&rdquo; behind. But if the reality is not what appears, have we any
means of knowing whether there is any reality at all ? And if so, have
we any means of finding out what it is like? (23)
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
As Russell notes, how we answer our question whether perceptual
appearances can <i>justify</i> beliefs about what empirical reality is like
depends on how we think perceptual appearances relate to the reality
that we think gives rise to them.
</p>

<p>
This will be our topic in the next unit, when we will consider in detail
two ways of thinking about how appearances connect to reality, theories
that have come to be known by the names of <b>Direct</b> and <b>Indirect
Realism</b>.
