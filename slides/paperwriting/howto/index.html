<p>What makes a philosophy paper successful?</p>


    </section>
    

    
    
    
    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Answer</h3>

A successful philosophy paper does two things:

</section>

<section>
1. It makes an <em>argument</em> for a specific <em>claim</em>; i.e., it <em>defends</em> a <em>thesis</em>!
</section>

<section>
2. The argument it makes is <em>intelligible</em> and <em>convincing</em> to the reader as well.
</section>

    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3> Step 1: Select a <em>thesis</em> </h3>
</section>

<section>
<h4> Exercise: What theses address the TP1 prompt? </h4>

How does Descartes reply to the "Cartesian Circle" objection in his <em>Objections & Replies</em>? In your view, is his reply successful? Why or why not?

</section>


    </section>
    

    
    
    
    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Step 2: Develop an <em>argument</em> for that thesis.</h3>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5> 1. Deductive [Must be Valid and Sound!] </h5>

All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. <br><br>

Moose is a dog. Moose does not have fleas. Therefore, not all dogs have fleas.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5> 2. Inductive [Sample Must be Representative!]</h5>

a, b, c, and d are all Fs which are also G. Therefore, <em>all</em> Fs are Gs.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5>3. Abductive [Must be Best Available Explanation!]</h5>

Increase in carbon emissions correlates with increasingly rapid climate change; there is no other correlation which could better explain increasingly rapid climate change; therefore, increase in carbon emissions <em>causes</em> climate change.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Exercise: What argument(s) support the theses that address the TP1 prompt?</h4>

(Hint: by identifying the form of argument Descartes is giving, we can develop a strategy for supporting or undermining it.)

</section>


    </section>
    

    
    
    
    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Step 3: Construct an outline<h3>
</section>

<section>
(Hint: your outline should present the argument in a way that your peers can understand.)
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>I. Introduction</h5>

Introduces the problem/question; draws in the reader; states thesis.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>II. Exegesis [Optional]</h5>

Adds any other relevant information that the reader must know in order to understand the argument to come.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>III. Body</h5>

States, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the argument for the thesis.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>IV. Conclusion</h5>

Provides extremely brief restatement of thesis and argument for it; convinces the reader of the significance of the paper's conclusion(s)
</section>

<section>
<h4>Exercise: Construct an outline for the TP1 thesis you've chosen.</h4>

(Hints: If you're arguing that Descartes' argument is successful, why is the most convincing argument against his conclusion incorrect? If you're arguing that his argument is unsuccessful, where does the argument go wrong?)

</section>


    </section>
    

    
    
    
    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Step 4: Fill in your outline with complete sentences<h3>
</section>

<section>

(Hint: Ideally, the most nested items in each "stem" of your outline will correspond to a single paragraph.)

<li>Write plainly!</li>

<li>Provide clear transitions: &lsquo;therefore&rsquo;, &lsquo;however&rsquo;, &hellip;</li>

<h4> 1. Argument reconstructions </h4>

Take an argumentative passage, identify the premises and conclusion, and restate the argument in your own words.
</section>

<section>
<h5>Sample Passage 1: Objections</h5>

<q>My only remaining concern is whether the author does not commit a vicious circle when he says that we have no other basis on which to establish that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true, than that God exists. But we can be certain that God exists only because we clearly and evidently perceive this fact. Therefore, before we are certain that God exists, we ought to be certain that whatever we clearly and evidently perceive is true.</q>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Sample Passage 2: Replies</h5>

<q>I drew a distinction between what we are actually perceiving clearly and what we recall having clearly perceived sometime earlier. For first of all it is manifest to us that God exists, since we are attending to the arguments that prove this; but later on, it is enough for us to recall our having clearly perceived something in order to be certain that it is true. This would not suffice, unless we knew that God exists and does not deceive us.</q>
