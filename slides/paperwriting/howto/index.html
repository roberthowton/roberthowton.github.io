<p>What makes a philosophy paper successful?</p>


    </section>
    

    
    
    
    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Answer</h3>

A successful philosophy paper does two things:

</section>

<section>
1. It makes an <em>argument</em> for a specific <em>claim</em>; i.e., it <em>defends</em> a <em>thesis</em>!
</section>

<section>
2. The argument it makes is <em>intelligible</em> and <em>convincing</em> to the reader as well.

<section>
<h3> Step 1: Select a <em>thesis</em> </h3>
</section>

<section>
<h4> Exercise: What theses address the TP1 prompt? </h4>

What does Sextus Empiricus mean when he says that "true", or Pyrrhonian, skeptics "hold no beliefs"? In your view, is it possible to live without holding any beliefs?

</section>


    </section>
    

    
    
    
    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Step 2: Develop an <em>argument</em> for that thesis.</h3>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5> 1. Deductive [Must be Valid and Sound!] </h5>

All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. <br><br>

Moose is a dog. Moose does not have fleas. Therefore, not all dogs have fleas.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5> 2. Inductive [Sample Must be Representative!]</h5>

a, b, c, and d are all Fs which are also G. Therefore, <em>all</em> Fs are Gs.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5>3. Abductive [Must be Best Available Explanation!]</h5>

Increase in carbon emissions correlates with increasingly rapid climate change; there is no other correlation which could better explain increasingly rapid climate change; therefore, increase in carbon emissions <em>causes</em> climate change.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Exercise: What argument(s) support the theses that address the TP1 prompt?</h4>

(Hint: by identifying the form of argument Descartes is giving, we can develop a strategy for supporting or undermining it.)

</section>


    </section>
    

    
    
    
    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Step 3: Construct an outline<h3>
</section>

<section>
(Hint: your outline should present the argument in a way that your peers can understand.)
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>I. Introduction</h5>

Introduces the problem/question; draws in the reader; states thesis.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>II. Exegesis [Optional]</h5>

Adds any other relevant information that the reader must know in order to understand the argument to come.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>III. Body</h5>

States, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the argument for the thesis.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>IV. Conclusion</h5>

Provides extremely brief restatement of thesis and argument for it; convinces the reader of the significance of the paper's conclusion(s)
</section>

<section>
<h4>Exercise: Construct an outline for the TP1 thesis you've chosen.</h4>

(Hints: If you're arguing that Sextus' argument is successful, why is the most convincing argument against his conclusion incorrect? If you're arguing that his argument is unsuccessful, where does the argument go wrong?)

    <section>
    
      

<section>
<h3>Step 4: Fill in your outline with complete sentences<h3>
</section>

<section>

(Hint: Ideally, the most nested items in each "stem" of your outline will correspond to a single paragraph.)

<section>
<h4> 1. Argument reconstructions </h4>

Take an argumentative passage, identify the premises and conclusion, and restate the argument in your own words.
</section>

<section>
<h5>Sample Passage 1: Skeptical Tranquility (PH I.29--30)</h5>

<q>We do not, however, take Skeptics to be undisturbed in every way---we say that they are disturbed by things which are forced upon them; for we agree that at times they shiver and are thirsty and have other feelings of this kind. But in these cases ordinary people are afflicted by two sets of circumstances: by the feelings themselves, and no less by believing that these circumstances are bad by nature. Skeptics, who shed the additional opinion that each of these things is bad in its nature, come off more moderately even in these cases.</q>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Sample Passage 2: Why Democritus is Not a Skeptic</h5>

<q>But the Skeptics and the Democriteans use the phrase 'No more' in different senses. The latter assign it the sense that neither is the case, we the sense that we do not know whether some apparent thing is both or neither. Hence even in this respect we differ. But the clearest distinction is made when Democritus says 'In verity there are atoms and void.' For by 'In verity' he means 'In truth'---and I think it is superfluous to remark that he differs from us in saying that atoms and void in truth subsist, even if he does begin from the anomaly in what is apparent.</q>
