Spurred by the ongoing revolution in science and the rediscovery of some lost works of Classical Greek and Roman philosophy, philosophers of this period turned away from the scholastic disputes practiced in the universities of Europe to a whole new set of philosophical questions, including: What am I? How do I relate to my body? Is knowledge possible? If so, where does it come from? For proponents of this new approach to philosophy, exploration of these questions did not require extensive education or training, only the exercise of one\u0026rsquo;s inborn rational faculties. For this reason, philosophy in this period also witnessed another revolution: the increasing influence of women philosophers.\nThis course will introduce you to the major questions and figures of 17th and 18th century philosophy in Western Europe. We begin with René Descartes, arguably the most important thinker of the 17th century. Descartes' philosophical work posed the questions with which subsequent philosophers would wrestle. After looking at Descartes' answers to these questions, we\u0026rsquo;ll turn to those of his contemporaries and successors, including Malebranche, Cavendish, Leibniz, Berkeley, Locke, and Hume. Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll close our survey with a look at the most important philosopher of the 18th century: Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental philosophy represents the culmination of Descartes' philosophical legacy.\nCourse Objectives This course will emphasize close reading, analysis, and evaluation of basic philosophical works from the early modern period, with the aim of establishing a broad understanding of the philosophical controversies of that period and cultivating the skills necessary for appreciating these and other topics in philosophy. The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate philosophical questions and ideas, both verbally and in writing, to read and critically assess philosophical literature, to identify the elements of an argument and assess it for soundness and validity, and to apply these skills to novel cases.  The key to success in this course is to keep up with the assigned readings and to attend and participate regularly in class activities.\n If you keep up with the lectures and readings you will not be assigned anything for which you are unprepared!   Course Components There are two basic components of this course, lectures and guided reading. Both components are mandatory, and both are moreover crucial for your success in this course.\nLectures The job of my lectures is to introduce you to the theories, concepts, and problems that make up the content of the course. These lectures will be accompanied by slide-show presentations, which I will share with you to use outside of lecture as a guide to reading the assigned texts. Hence, you will not be expected to come to the lecture having read the material assigned for that day, but rather to use what you learn in lecture to help you read the text on your own.\nGuided Reading After attending lecture, you will be responsible for working your way through the assigned readings. The assigned readings are inevitably difficult: they are texts written centuries ago for audiences very different from us, a fact which accounts as much for their enduring interest as their difficulty for modern readers. The lectures are designed to help you as you work out the meaning of the text for yourself, providing you with the necessary context, key ideas, and outlines of important arguments. Your progress in coming to grips with these texts by a series of reading responses assigned for each Unit, which you will turn in for credit one week after the completion of the relevant Unit.\nEvaluation Your success in meeting these objectives will be assessed on the following bases:\n  Completion of four reading responses assigned at the beginning of each Unit and due one week after its completion. The questions assigned in each of the reading responses are designed to orient your reading as well as to gauge your comprehension of the assigned texts.\n  Two 3\u0026ndash;5 page argument analysis papers, each dedicated to an important passage discussed in lecture.\n  Additionally, students will assessed for participation by means of self-assessments prepared by the student after each Unit. See below for more information.\n  Self-Assessment Participation is crucial for grasping the content and developing the skills at which this course aims. However, there are more ways to participate in a course than just verbal, in-class participation, which can also be exclusionary, imprecise to grade, and insensitive to students whose circumstances at home are not optimized for remote learning. Rather than traditional participation, we will use self-assessments to reflect on how we have engage with the course in general, or supported others in their engagement, and how we might improve our efforts. To this end, I will be assigning self-assessment quizzes (on Blackboard) at end of every Unit.\n You are required to fill out a self-assessment for every unit.   I intend to be as inclusive as possible in assessing your efforts to engage with the course. Participation and engagement in the course might include, but are certainly not limited to:\n doing course readings or accessing preparatory material; asking or answering questions in class; contributing to class discussion; engaging with the contributions of others in a charitable and respectful way; discussing course material (in person or online) with others outside of class, including with those not enrolled in this course; starting or contributing to discussions on blogs or social media; seeking out additional resources on course topics, such as articles, books, podcasts, or lectures; taking detailed notes on course readings; sharing your academic strategies, tips, and habits with others; creating and sharing artistic media relating to course content, such as drawings, paintings, poetry, music, comics, videos, podcasts, or short stories; visiting a museum (virtually or in person) or seeking out artistic works in other ways and sharing how these works relate to course topics; reflecting either in writing or in discussion on the relation of course topics to recent news stories, opinion pieces,or magazine articles or to research, theories, or findings from other disciplines.   Our ability to credit you with these modes of engagement depends on your ability to document them, so please be detailed and, if possible, provide evidence!

Initially, Aristotle seems to have proposed a hylomorphic conception of substance to deal with certain challenges to the possibility of change, in particular substantial change, in which there comes to be a human or a house from what was not one before. But the impact of this thesis on Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s thought extends far beyond the resolution of these challenges, influencing most crucially his theory of being in Metaphysics Z, his explanation of life in De Anima, and the whole of the biological theory he develops in the Parts and Generation of Animals.\nThis course will be an in-depth examination of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s hylomorphism, its theoretical motivations, and its philosophical difficulties. We will read widely from Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s works in metaphysics and natural science, while drawing on both recent scholarly and neo-Aristotelian treatments of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of substance.\nCourse Objectives The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s metaphysics and natural science and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and related issues in ancient and contemporary philosophy.\nLearning Outcomes The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s hylomorphism, to read and critically assess relevant primary and secondary literature, to apply these skills to novel cases.   If you keep up with the lectures and readings you will not be assigned anything for which you are unprepared!   Course Components Students' success in meeting these course goals will be evaluated on the following bases:\n  Undergraduate students will be expected to write two passage commentaries of roughly 7 pages each. The commentaries are designed to stimulate in-depth historical and philosophical engagement with one of the major passages discussed in class and the relevant secondary literature. Undergraduates who earn an A- or higher on their first commentary can petition to write a roughly 7 page term paper (Term Paper 2 style; see below) in lieu of a second commentary.\n  Graduate students will be expected to write three 5\u0026ndash;7 page term papers, each addressing a substantive interpretive issue concerning Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s metaphysics, natural science, and/or related philosophical issues. These papers are intended to be exercises in advanced philosophical writing, so students will be responsible for submitting substantial outlines and preliminary drafts, on which I will provide comments aimed at helping the student compose a well-written and cogently argued final draft. Additionally, students will be given progressively greater discretion over the subject of their papers over the course of the term:\n Term Paper 1 topics will be chosen from a list of prompts given by me. Term Paper 2 topics may either be chosen from a list of prompts given by me or proposed by the student in consultation with me. Term Paper 3 topics must be proposed by the student in consultation with me.    Participation will be evaluated on the basis of student participation in discussions both in lecture meetings and outside of lecture meetings in the course chat (see below).\n   Finally, undergraduate students will make one, and graduate students two, 10\u0026ndash;15 minute in-class presentations. Students due to present in a given week will also be required to post three reading questions to the course chat no later than the Tuesday of that week.

Sometimes, however, things are not as they appear. We see a straight stick in the water as bent, or are taken in by a vivid dream or hallucination, or treat as reliable a source that turns out to peddle fake news. How do these various illusions impact our efforts to learn from experience? What strategies can we adopt\u0026mdash;as individuals, as researchers, and as citizens\u0026mdash;to combat these sorts of error? And what happens when things go right, when our senses teach us how the world really is? This course will explore these and similar questions concerning illusions in their many forms, drawing on resources past and present from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and the sociology of science.\nCourse Objectives This course aims to help students:\n Gain an appreciation for the various forms of illusion and perceptual error and their significance in our cognitive lives; Come to understand the cultural and historical influences shaping our notions of illusion, perception, and reality; and Think freely and critically about how these issues affect them as individuals, researchers, and citizens.  Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the successful student will have demonstrated the ability to:\n express philosophical ideas clearly, both verbally and in writing; read and critically assess philosophical and other academic literature; identify the elements of an argument and assess it for soundness and validity; and apply these skills to novel cases.  The key to success in this course is to keep up with the assigned readings and to attend and participate regularly in class activities.\n If you keep up with the lectures and readings you will not be assigned anything for which you are unprepared!   Course Logistics This course will be taught remotely this semester. In accordance with University guidelines, all class meetings will be held on Zoom, recorded, and posted to the course Blackboard page after the fact. This policy is intended to accommodate students who are unable to attend class meetings when they are held, not as a substitute for attendance and participation in class meetings.\nClass time will be divided between lecture meetings, which will take place Tuesdays and Thursdays, and discussion meetings, which will take place on Fridays.\n The purpose of lecture meetings is to introduce course material and prepare you for reading the texts assigned for that Unit. You should come to the first lecture meeting of the week having engaged with the preparatory material; after the first meeting, you\u0026rsquo;ll be in a position to start with the assigned reading. The purpose of discussion meetings is to give you the opportunity to discuss ideas and problems arising from the lecture and assignments with a smaller group of your peers. Discussions will be led by one of the course TAs. You should come having completed the readings and other assignments due that week. Ideally, you will also come with questions for discussion. Attendance at these meetings is mandatory and enforced by weekly quizzes.   Philosophy is, and has always been, a discursive enterprise. Without testing your understanding of the ideas and theories you\u0026rsquo;re exposed to in class through questions and thoughtful discussion with your peers, \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n -- Course Components Each student\u0026rsquo;s success in meeting the course objectives and learning outcomes will be assessed on the following bases:\n Students will be expected to earn a Master of Illusion Certificate from the University of Glasgow. Additionally, students will be expected to write three short papers responding to questions about assigned readings and other course material. Students unsatisfied with their initial score on a short paper assignment may write a second draft addressing problems identified by instructor/TA comments on the first draft; the student\u0026rsquo;s final grade on that short paper assignment will then be the average of the first and second draft grades. Additionally, students will assessed for attendance and participation:  Attendance in discussion meetings will be assessed by weekly quizzes administered during discussion meetings, which will the readings assigned for that week. Participation will be assessed by means of self-assessments prepared by the student after each Unit. See below for more information.

So far, however, no commentators have addressed\nAgainst recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination:  Answering these questions leads us to reject two claims central to many recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination in Aristotle:  That Aristotle regards being κριτική as essential to, or partially definitive of, αἴσθησις: see most recently Perälä, but also by Ebert, De Haas [CHECK Corcilius, Herzberg, Johansen] That Aristotle, in stressing that αἴσθησις is κριτική, is emphasizing that the power to perceive is, in some primary sense, a power to discriminate or tell apart sensible qualities and sensible bodies. (A line of interpretation initially proposed by Ebert but which has been accepted by all [?] subsequent interpreters.)    In contrast, I\u0026rsquo;ll argue that:   The power to discriminate is not a feature of the essence of the senses, but rather a demonstrable feature of them.\n  Aristotle provides two arguments aimed at demonstrating that αἴσθησις is κριτική, one final causal and one formal causal:\n According to the final causal argument, αἴσθησις is and must be κριτική in order to promote the ends for whose sake it belongs to living things that have αἴσθησις:  αἴσθησις is present in all animals for the sake of survival and, ultimately, reproduction; the presence of αἴσθησις additionally promotes animals' cognitive function; finally, in humans, αἴσθησις is cited as the capacity from which potential knowers acquire knowledge of the indemonstrable principles of a demonstrative science.   According to the formal causal argument, αἴσθησις is κριτική because each sense (αἴσθησις) is a mean state of the opposition present in the qualities each perceives, and the mean is in every case κριτική.    Seen in the light of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s arguments, the conclusion that αἴσθησις is κριτική appears radically different: not an affirmation that perception is the cognition of difference but of the basic fidelity of the senses. For Aristotle, the senses are not only a source of knowledge; perception itself is a form of knowledge. And the basis for this claim is that perception, in its most basic form, is criterial for the presence of the sensible qualities it perceives; that perceivers, by virtue of having the capacity to perceive, occupy a privileged perspective with respect to the sensible objects and qualities of which they are critical.\n  Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s predecessors on perceptual κρίσις Anaxagoras Democritus Plato Aristotle in response to his predecessors Two arguments for perceptual κρίσις The final causal argument The formal causal argument Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Protagoreanism Concluding remarks The foregoing has sketched a fragment of a debate whose origin and terminus far exceed the scope of this paper. At its inception is a pre-Platonic skepticism about the reliability of the senses, at its terminus a sophisticated between skeptics and so-called dogmatists about the status of perception as a \u0026ldquo;criterion of truth\u0026rdquo; and source of knowledge. My hope is that this paper has shown that Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s case for the fidelity of the senses is more formative for this debate than we have previously acknowledged.\n","date":1557910347,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1574094096,"objectID":"6968f96a0db909cf430c8fb8bc642fbd","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/post/krisis/","publishdate":"2019-05-15T11:52:27+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/krisis/","section":"post","summary":"Table of Contents  Introduction Against recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination: In contrast, I\u0026rsquo;ll argue that: Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s predecessors on perceptual κρίσις  Anaxagoras Democritus Plato   Aristotle in response to his predecessors Two arguments for perceptual κρίσις  The final causal argument The formal causal argument   Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Protagoreanism Concluding remarks   Introduction In several passages of his natural scientific treatises, Aristotle expresses commitment to the thesis that sense-perception (aisthêsis) is kritikê, discriminative or (better, as I shall argue) criterial.","tags":[],"title":"Aristotle's Arguments for the Perceptual Criterion","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Stemma \u0026amp; Sigla Families          α ECcXyLHaMoBpOaWzvZaNCaUSOdW + (until approximately 442b26) V   β BePΓ2   γ XyLHaMoBpOaWzvZaNCaUSOdW + (until approximately 442b26) V   δ XyLHa + (until approximately 444b1) MoOaBpWz   ε vZaNCaUSOdW + (from approximately 444b1) MoOaBpWz + (until approximately 442b26) V   λ XyLHa   ν LHa   μ MoOaBpWz   A vZa   π N + (until approximately 442b26) V   η SOdW    Manuscripts          E Paris. gr. 1853, mid-10th century   Cc Paris.

More often than not, philosophers have sought the answer to this question by looking to the nature of perceptual experience itself, asking for instance whether perception is a relation, what accounts for the phenomenal or qualitative character of perceptual experience, and how perceptual experiences manage to represent a mind-independent reality. In this course we will take a different starting point: the nature of the objects of perception themselves. Our primary focus will be color, a phenomenon that seems, paradoxically, at once the most familiar and most incomprehensible feature of the world familiar to our experience. Beginning with the science of color vision and the relation between the familiar hues and the structure of our visual system, we\u0026rsquo;ll go on to consider questions of the nature of the colors, their relation to the physical properties of objects that appear colored, and how visual experience gives us knowledge of them.

The first, which develops themes from my dissertation, concerns Aristotle’s views on the epistemic value of sense perception. The second concerns the status of soul as an explanatory principle in Aristotle’s natural science. Below I provide an overview of these topics. In Papers I detail some papers in progress or projected on these and related topics, and in Book Project I outline a book project, Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination, that draws together the major topics of my research.\nAristotle\u0026rsquo;s Theory of Perceptual Discrimination Aristotle conceives of perception as a process that is at once causal and “cognitive,” a means by which the perceiver comes to know something about the world. Disputes over perception’s causal aspect have roiled for decades, but until recently little scholarly attention has been paid to its cognitive aspect. I aim to increase our understanding of this crucial aspect of Aristotle’s celebrated theory of perception by elucidating one of its most important and contentious theses: that perception is a discriminative capacity of soul.\nI laid the foundations for this project in my doctoral dissertation, Aristotle’s Case for Perceptual Knowledge. Against a range of competing interpretations, I argued that Aristotle’s thesis, and the theory of perceptual discrimination he develops in support of it, is a direct response to a well-known Platonic argument against perceptual knowledge. To say, for instance, that sight “discriminates” color is on Aristotle’s view to say that seeing the color of a body is a way of knowing its color. This interpretation, I argued, enables us to see why Aristotle thinks it is by discriminating that the senses promote animals’ diverse practical and intellectual goals, and so why he also rejects the view, almost universally accepted by his predecessors, that perception is an impediment to knowledge.\nI am at work on a series of papers elaborating this approach to the cognitive aspect of perception in Aristotle’s psychology, the ontology of color and other sensible qualities on which it relies, and its role in teleological explanations of the value of perception for rational and non-rational animals. One paper, \u0026ldquo;Reduction and Revelation in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Science of Sensible Qualities\u0026rdquo;, will be published in a volume currently in preparation on Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s De Sensu. Another, “Perception and Hypothetical Necessity in Posterior Analytics 2.19,\u0026quot; is being revised for resubmission to Ancient Philosophy. Additionally, I am planning a book, Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination, aimed at situating Aristotle’s theory of perceptual discrimination within his general teleological approach to explaining the natural attributes of living things by reference to the contributions those attributes make to the ends living things naturally pursue.\nSoul as a \u0026ldquo;Complex Activity\u0026rdquo; in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Natural Science Commentators have found a conflict between the theory and explanatory practice of Aristotle’s biology. In theory, the soul of a living thing\u0026mdash;its form and essence\u0026mdash;is supposed to explain each of its natural attributes, but in practice Aristotle seems to admit that some of a living thing’s natural attributes are due, not to its soul, but to its matter. I argue that this conflict is only apparent. We can see the soul as the basis even of these explanations if we take seriously Aristotle’s claim that the soul is a “certain complex activity,” a diverse collection of vital functions aimed at a single, teleologically primary goal, such as reproduction.\nI am at work on a series of papers aimed at elucidating this “complex activity” model of soul and its role in Aristotle’s natural science. The first, which appears in Murgier, Louguet, and Guyomarc’h (eds.), Aristote et l’âme humaine. Lectures de De Anima III offertes à Michel Crubellier (Peeters, 2020), argues that Aristotle uses the complex activity model in De Anima to explain the psychological attributes of living things. In subsequent papers, I plan to extend this interpretation to Aristotle’s explanations of animals’ physiological attributes in the Generation of Animals and the Parts of Animals, where the soul is presented respectively as the efficient and final cause of these attributes.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"bc8c75ec10f4acb491c3299f2f23af66","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/research/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"research","summary":"Overview My current research focuses on two related topics in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s psychology and natural philosophy.

For many epistemologists, both ancient and modern, whether and how knowledge is attainable depends on whether we possess some criterion or standard by which to judge what is the case from what merely appears to be the case. This idea, that knowledge requires a criterion of truth, has its origins in antiquity, in Hellenistic debates between so-called Dogmatists and Skeptics about whether human beings possess\u0026mdash;or can ever possess\u0026mdash;such a criterion. Our aim in this course will be to explore the ancient roots of this \u0026ldquo;problem of the criterion\u0026rdquo;, in order to gain a better understanding of the various arguments and positions of the dogmatic and skeptical Hellenistic schools, as well as the prehistory of this debate in Hellenic figures such as Protagoras, Democritus, and, more controversially, Plato and Aristotle.\nCourse Objectives The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in ancient epistemology and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and other issues in ancient and contemporary philosophy.\nLearning Outcomes The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to ancient epistemology, to read and critically assess relevant primary and secondary literature, to apply these skills to novel cases.

Course Components Students' success in meeting these course goals will be evaluated on the following bases:\n  Undergraduate students will be expected to write two passage commentaries. The commentaries are designed to stimulate in-depth historical and philosophical engagement with one of the major passages discussed in class and relevant secondary literature.\n  Graduate students will be expected to write either a passage commentary and a 12\u0026ndash;15 page final paper or a 20 page final paper. The final paper will address a substantive interpretive issue concerning Hellenistic epistemology and/or related philosophical issues. Topics and secondary literature will be selected in consultation with me.\n  Class participation will be evaluated on the basis of the student\u0026rsquo;s answer to periodic reading response questions, which will be distributed in advance and must be turned in prior to the start of the meeting in which the relevant reading is to be discussed.

The deadline for choosing a presentation date and topic is 2 March by 23:59. Students who have not signed up by that time will have a date and topic chosen by me.\nPresentation Format and Questions Each presentation must be accompanied by a slide show, which will be submitted to me on the day of the presentation. Slide shows should dedicate a slide (or a section of the slide show) to answering each of the following questions.\nAdditionally, presenters will be asked to share discussion questions\u0026mdash;which may or may not be identical to the student\u0026rsquo;s answer to question 5 below\u0026mdash;no later than the Tuesday before the Thursday they are scheduled to present\n  What is the problem or puzzle the paper addresses?\nSince the papers we will be discussing are interpretive, aimed at developing and defending a reading of a passage (or set of passages) of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s corpus, the problem/puzzle in question will most likely concern an interpretive difficulty, a challenge for understanding some aspect of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s thought.\n  How have scholars previously proposed to address or solve the problem with which the paper is concerned?\nThat is, what other interpretations does the author intend to criticize?\n  What alternative does the author propose?\nHow does the author, in contrast to previous scholars, propose to address or solve the problem in question?\n  Why does the author think their alternative is superior to previous attempts to solve or address the problem?\nWhat evidence and/or arguments does the author put forward in favor of their interpretation, and why, according to the author, do these considerations rule out competing proposals?\n  What questions might be raised about the author\u0026rsquo;s proposal?\nDo the considerations the author puts forward in favor of their interpretation in fact provide conclusive support for that interpretation? What other substantive questions arise if the author\u0026rsquo;s interpretation is correct? What response(s) might be given on behalf of the interpretations the author criticizes?\n  Assessment Presentations are worth a maximum of 20 points and will be assessed on the quality of their answers to the above questions.\n   Quality Points Earned Student Performance     Superlative 20\u0026ndash;18 Answers to all questions are clear, concise, and insightful.

A commentary is a detailed, line-by-line \u0026ldquo;explication\u0026rdquo; of a text. From Late Antiquity through the Middle Ages, several commentaries were commentaries were written on a wide variety of ancient texts, each with the aims of (1) explaining difficult aspects of the text for novice readers, (2) resolving textual ambiguities, and (3) exploring the philosophical, literary, or historical questions raised by the text. For similar reasons modern \u0026ldquo;critical editions\u0026rdquo; of ancient texts are also often accompanied by commentaries.\nThe Structure of a Commentary Commentaries can differ significantly in organization and focus depending on the commentator\u0026rsquo;s interest, whether it is the literary character of a text, its historical transmission, its connection with other ancient literature, or its philosophical content. But whatever its focus, any commentary will have something like the following structure:\n The commentary will begin by introducing the text, giving its overall context, aims, and reception by ancient and modern readers. The commentator then proceeds slowly through the text, section-by-section, line-by-line, (a) clarifying the meaning of and (b) raising questions about the text, (c) making cross-references to other relevant passages, and (d) discussing alternative interpretations of the text. Each new section to be discussed is introduced by a lemma, an abbreviated quotation of a line of the text that introduces the issues to be discussed. Paraphrase is discouraged; claims referenced from the text are cited by page and line number (e.g., Stephanus pages for Plato\u0026rsquo;s works, Bekker lines for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s)  Requirements for Your Philosophical Commentary You will be writing a philosophical commentary. This means that your commentary will be dedicated to explicating the philosophical content of the text you choose. Here are some features your philosophical commentary must include:\n Avoid paraphrase. It will be more helpful to your reader if you explain the meaning of a passage, rather than put the same claim into different words. Break down the text into its logical components; dedicate a section of your commentary to each component of the text. Consider alternative readings. Many sentences will be ambiguous. Pointing out the ambiguities and discussing the implications of alternative readings will help you and your reader understand the text. Reference other passages, especially those which illuminate the context of the passage or contain more in depth discussion of ideas referenced in the text. Keep the context in focus. What is the author\u0026rsquo;s project in the local context of the passage? What is the project of the containing work as a whole? How ought the context influence our interpretation of the text on which you are commenting?

Parsing the definition Hylomorphism posits a relationship between three items: substance, form, and matter.\nSubstance (ousia) Comes from the from the Greek \u0026ldquo;to be\u0026rdquo; (einai):\n  Prior to Aristotle, has a variety of meanings:\n  \u0026ldquo;Property\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;that which is one\u0026rsquo;s own\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Being\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;reality\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;existence\u0026rdquo; (to on) - Charles Kahn\n    Both senses seem to be at work in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s conception of substance:\n  (1) Substance as essence   For Aristotle, the ousia of a thing is identical to \u0026ldquo;what it is\u0026rdquo; (ti esti) or, as it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes known, it\u0026rsquo;s essence.\n  The \u0026ldquo;what it is\u0026rdquo; corresponds to a thing\u0026rsquo;s definition (horos, horismos, lit. \u0026ldquo;limits\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;boundaries\u0026rdquo;), or what we know when we know what something is, it\u0026rsquo;s essence.\n  The association between ousia, ti esti, and definition precedes Aristotle. Recall:\n  Socrates (in the Platonic dialogues at least) famously traces disputes about the status of some action as virtuous, or the properties of a given virtue, to questions about what that virtue is:\n Plato, Meno 70a\u0026ndash;b\nMENO: Can you tell me, Socrates, can virtue be taught? Or is it not teachable but the result of practice, or is it neither of these, but men possess it by nature or in some other way?\nSOCRATES: \u0026hellip;I myself, Meno, am as poor as my fellow citizens in this matter, and I blame myself for my complete ignorance about virtue. If I do not know what something is, how could I know what qualities it possesses? Or do you think that someone who does not know at all who Meno is could know whether he is good-looking or rich or well-born, or the opposite of these? Do you think that is possible?\n   Plato famously follows Socrates in thinking of the objects of knowledge as corresponding to the \u0026ldquo;what it is\u0026rdquo;, or essence, of what we know\u0026mdash;with one major difference.\n Plato, Phaedo 70b\u0026ndash;c\nThen before we began to see or hear or otherwise perceive, we must have possessed knowledge of the Equal itself if we were about to refer our sense perceptions of equal objects to it, and realized that all of them were eager to be like it, but were inferior.\nThat follows from what has been said, Socrates.\nBut we began to see and hear and otherwise perceive right after birth?\nCertainly.\nWe must then have acquired the knowledge of the Equal before this.\nYes.\nIt seems then that we must have possessed it before birth.\nIt seems so.\nTherefore, if we had this knowledge, we knew before birth and immedi- ately after not only the Equal, but the Greater and the Smaller and all such things, for our present argument is no more about the Equal than about d the Beautiful itself, the Good itself, the Just, the Pious and, as I say, about all those things which we mark with the seal of \u0026ldquo;what it is,\u0026rdquo; both when we are putting questions and answering them. So we must have acquired knowledge of them all before we were born.\n     Here\u0026rsquo;s how Aristotle characterizes the difference:\n Aristotle, Metaphysics A 6, 987a28\u0026ndash;b12\nAfter the systems we have named came the philosophy of Plato, which in most respects followed these thinkers, but had peculiarities that distinguished it [30] from the philosophy of the Italians. For, having in his youth first become familiar with Cratylus and with the Heraclitean doctrines (that all sensible things are ever in a state of flux and there is no knowledge about them), these views he held even in later years. Socrates, however, was busying himself about ethical matters and [987b1] neglecting the world of nature as a whole but seeking the universal in these ethical matters, and fixed thought for the first time on definitions; Plato accepted his teaching, but held that the problem applied not to any sensible thing but to entities [5] of another kind—for this reason, that the common definition could not be a definition of any sensible thing, as they were always changing. Things of this other sort, then, he called Ideas, and sensible things, he said, were apart from these, and were all called after these; for the multitude of things which have the same name as the Form exist by participation in it. Only the name ‘participation’ was new; for the [10] Pythagoreans say that things exist by imitation of numbers, and Plato says they exist by participation, changing the name. But what the participation or the imitation of the Forms could be they left an open question.\n   (2) Substance as \u0026ldquo;what is\u0026rdquo;    to on in Presocratic thought\n Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s testimony alludes to a distinction that occupied Plato as well as Presocrates like Parmenides, Melissus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus: the distinction between \u0026ldquo;what is\u0026rdquo; (to on) and \u0026ldquo;what is not\u0026rdquo; (to mē on).   Parmenides and his Eleatic \u0026ldquo;school\u0026rdquo; famously challenged the possibility of change (or \u0026ldquo;coming to be\u0026rdquo;) on the grounds that it is impossible for there to be anything except to on:\n  A quick \u0026amp; dirty version of the Eleatic argument:\n  Parmenides: not only is it impossible for to mē on to be, it is impossible to think or even say to mē on.\n  If what-is \u0026ldquo;came to be\u0026rdquo; (ginesthai), it previously was not.\n  What is not cannot be.\n  Therefore, what-is did not come to be.\n  Therefore, coming to be (change) is impossible.\n    The ontological theories of the so-called Eleatic pluralists\u0026mdash;Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus\u0026mdash;are often read as attempts to explain change in a way consistent with Eleatic principles:\n  Empedocles argued that what-is (the four elements) exists in an eternal cycle of combination and separation governed by the causal principles Love and Strife.\n  Anaxagoras argued that \u0026ldquo;all is in all\u0026rdquo;, and that the macroscopic differences in things are brought about by alternating shifts in the preponderance of some properties over others in different portions of the cosmic mixture, the changes being brought about and ordered by Nous (mind).\n  Democritus (and Leucippus) argued that to on and to mē on both equally are: to on are indivisible (atomic) bodies, to mē on is the void through which they travel, combine, and separate with one another. Macroscopic change is just the combination and separation of unchanging microscopic atoms.\n           to on in Plato\n  Plato picks up on this distinction, dividing the objects of cognition between coming-to-be (genesis), which we apprehend by means of the senses, and what is (ousia), which we apprehend by thought. (Republic 7, 534a)\n  More strikingly, Plato seems to have ontologically separated the objects of perception and the objects of thought, and reserved the designation \u0026ldquo;real being\u0026rdquo; (to ontōs on) for the objects of thought:\n Plato, Timaeus 52a\u0026ndash;b\nSince these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere else, nor itself enters into anything else anywhere, is one thing. It is invisi- ble\u0026mdash;it cannot be perceived by the senses at all\u0026mdash;and it is the role of understanding to study it. The second thing is that which shares the other\u0026rsquo;s name and resembles it. This thing can be perceived by the senses, and it has been begotten. It is constantly borne along, now coming to be in a certain place and then perishing out of it. It is apprehended by opinion, which involves sense perception. And the third type is space, which exists always and cannot be destroyed. It provides afixed state for all things that come to be. It is itself apprehended by a kind of bastard reasoning that does not involve sense perception, and it is hardly even an object of conviction. We look at it as in a dream when we say that everything that exists must of necessity be somewhere, in some place and occupying some space, and that that which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist somewhere, whether on earth or in heaven, doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist at all.\n   This distinction is a central component of Plato\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Theory of Forms\u0026rdquo;, so called because he reserved the word eidos, form, for the real beings apprehended solely by thought\u0026hellip;\n    Aristotle on substance  Question What is a substance in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s theory? Answer Depends on where you look!   Categories: Substance is:\n  In the strictest sense, what is \u0026ldquo;neither said of nor present in a subject\u0026rdquo; (2a11\u0026ndash;13)\n  \u0026ldquo;A certain this\u0026rdquo; (tode ti), i.e., something \u0026ldquo;indivisible\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;numerically one\u0026rdquo; (3b10\u0026ndash;11).\n    Metaphysics Z: The substance of a thing (e.g. some tode ti) could be:\n  Essence\n  A \u0026ldquo;universal\u0026rdquo;\n  The genus\n  The subject of predication\n  The \u0026ldquo;cause of being\u0026rdquo; (Z 17)\n    Observation: Matter and form play a significant role of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s discussion of substance in Metaphysics Z, but not in Categories.\n  The Puzzle: How do the Categories and Metaphysics Z accounts of substance relate? Do Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s views on substance develop? If so, how does the introduction of hylomorphism influence the development of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s views?\n    Form (morphē, eidos)   Aristotle has two words for form:\n  Eidos (lit., \u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo;), which comes from the (related) Greek words \u0026ldquo;to see\u0026rdquo; (oida) and \u0026ldquo;to know\u0026rdquo; (eidenai).\n  Morphē, which means \u0026ldquo;shape\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;appearance\u0026rdquo;.\n    What is distinctive about Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s conception of form?\n  Towards an answer:\n  Recall what Aristotle says of Plato\u0026rsquo;s reception of Socrates:\n  Socrates was the first to draw attention to definitions.\n  Plato, however, was convinced that the sensible world was in a state of constant flux and change, which meant that what definitions define could not be anything sensible.\n  Hence the objects of definition must be separate from the mutable objects of perception and, unlike them, imperceptible, stable, unchanging, fully what they are, etc. etc.\n    Aristotle famously denies that that forms are separable in the way Plato claimed (see On Ideas):\n  To say that forms are separable from sensible \u0026ldquo;particulars\u0026rdquo; implies that forms could be without sensibles (Metaphysics Δ 11)\n  To the contrary, Aristotle believes that nothing would be without \u0026ldquo;primary\u0026rdquo; substances:\n Aristotle, Categories 5, 2a35\u0026ndash;b5\nAll the other things are either said of the primary substances as subjects or in [35] them as subjects. This is clear from an examination of cases. For example, animal is predicated of man and therefore also of the individual man; for were it predicated of none of the individual men it would not be predicated of man at all. Again, colour is [2b1] in body and therefore also in an individual body; for were it not in some individual body it would not be in body at all. Thus all the other things are either said of the primary substances as subjects or in them as subjects. So if the primary substances [5] did not exist it would be impossible for any of the other things to exist.\n       Aside: (little \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo;) platonic vs. (little \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;) aristotelian theories of universals  Universal What is \u0026ldquo;said of\u0026rdquo; many things, e.g. redness, \u0026ldquo;human being\u0026rdquo; Particular What is not \u0026ldquo;said of\u0026rdquo; many things, e.g. scarlet, this scarlet letter, Socrates Question Would scarlet exist if nothing were scarlet colored?   (Little \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo;) platonic response: Yes! Universals are not ontologically dependent on their particular instances.\n  (Little \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;) aristotelian response: No! Universals depend on their particular instances.\n    Controversies over Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s theory of form   Are Aristotelian forms particular or universal?\n  If form corresponds to the essence and definition of a thing, is it also the substance of that thing?\n  Is form always the form of some matter?\n  Matter (hulē)   Literally means \u0026ldquo;wood\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stick\u0026rdquo;, but Aristotle associates it with two features of particulars:\n  The \u0026ldquo;subject\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;substratum\u0026rdquo; (hupokeimenon) of which properties are predicated.

So they say nothing else comes to be or ceases to be; for there must be some entity—either one or more than one—from which all other things come to be, it being conserved.\n   No clear Socratic or Platonic precedent\u0026mdash;although compare Plato\u0026rsquo;s notion of \u0026ldquo;space\u0026rdquo; (chōrē) in Timaeus.\n  Aristotle often speaks of matter as a relative term: all matter is the matter of something:\n  The matter of the chair is wood\n  The matter of the wood is earth\n  However, the matter of the chair is not earth.\n  matter is the potential for form, which, in turn, is that actualization of some material potential.\n    Questions for Unit 1   How does Aristotle understand being and substance in the Organon?\n  Is this a framework within which we can make senses of a hylomorphic analysis of substance?\n  ","date":1614774480,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615808757,"objectID":"718ddf1af3718126bad2667034d537aa","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/course-hylomorphism/lectures/introduction/","publishdate":"2021-03-03T15:28:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/course-hylomorphism/lectures/introduction/","section":"course-hylomorphism","summary":"Hylomorphism defined  Hylomorphism The metaphysical theory that a substance is a composite of \u0026ldquo;form\u0026rdquo; (morphē, eidos) and \u0026ldquo;matter\u0026rdquo; (hulē).

The species in which the things primarily called substances are, are called secondary substances, as also are the genera of these species. For example, the individual man belongs in a species, man, and animal is a genus of the species; so these—both man and animal—are called secondary substances.\n Characteristics of substance in Cat. 5   Substance is not present in anything:\n  Primary substances are neither said of nor present in anything else as subject.\n  Secondary substances are said of primary substances, but present in nothing.\n  Differentia too are not present in anything as subject, but they are neither primary nor secondary substances\u0026hellip;\n Question: How then do differentia fit into the Cat. 2 division of beings?

In no other case could one bring forward anything, numerically one, which is able to receive contraries. For example, a colour which is numerically one and the same will not be black and white, nor will numerically one and the same action be bad and good; and similarly with everything [15] else that is not substance. A substance, however, numerically one and the same, is able to receive contraries. For example, an individual man—one and the same—becomes pale at one time and dark at another, and hot and cold, and bad and [20] good.\n   Ontology \u0026amp; Explanation in the Prior Analytics Basics of Aristotelian Syllogistic   A term (A, B, C, \u0026hellip;) is what is predicated and what it is predicated of in a premise.\n  A premise is a sentence that affirms or denies one term of another:\n  Affirmation: \u0026ldquo;A belongs to B\u0026rdquo;\n  Denial: \u0026ldquo;A does not belong to B\u0026rdquo;\n  Premises are distinguished by quantity (and quality, i.e. necessity, possibility).\n    Affirmation Denial     Universal A belongs to all B A belongs to no B   Particular A belongs to some B A does not belong to some B    Schematically:\n  Universal Affirmative: AaB\n  Universal Negative: AeB\n  Particular Affirmative: AiB\n  Particular Negative: AoB\n      A syllogism is \u0026ldquo;a logos in which, certain things being posited (i.e., the premises), something else (i.e., the conclusion) results by necessity because these things are so\u0026rdquo; (24b18\u0026ndash;20).\n Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s syllogistic is the formal study of what combinations of premises produce syllogisms, using three tools:   Three rules of conversion (APr. 1.2)\n  AeB → BeA: If A belongs to no B, B belongs to no A.\n  AiB → BiA: If A belongs to some B, B belongs to some A.\n  AaB → BiA: If A belongs to all B, B belongs to some A. (Note: Aristotle assumes terms are non-empty!)\n    Arguments from impossibility (reductio ad absurdum)\n  \u0026ldquo;I call a syllogism perfect if it requires nothing beyond the things posited for the necessity to be evident.\u0026rdquo;\n  According to Aristotle, syllogisms of the First Figure are all perfect:\n   Mnemonic Form     Barbara AaB, BaC \\vdash AaC   Celarent AeB, BaC \\vdash AeC   Darii AaB, BiC \\vdash AiC   Ferio AeB, BiC \\vdash AoC      Syllogisms in the second and third figures proved by conversion and reduction to one of the \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; first figure syllogisms; figures differ according to where the middle term (the term that appears in both premises) appears in each premise.\n  Second Figure\n   Mnemonic Form     Ceasare AeB, AaC \\vdash BeC   Camestres AaB, AeC \\vdash BeC   Festino AeB, AiC \\vdash BoC   Baroco AaB, AoC \\vdash BoC      Third Figure\n   Mnemonic Form     Darapti AaC, BaC \\vdash AiB   Felapton AeC, BaC \\vdash AoB   Disamis AiC, BaC \\vdash AiB   Datisi AaC, BiC \\vdash AiB   Bocardo AoC, BaC \\vdash AoB   Ferison AeC, BiC \\vdash AoB              Syllogistic and Explanation  Demonstration A \u0026ldquo;knowledge-yielding\u0026rdquo; syllogism; a syllogism grasp of which imparts scientific knowledge (epistēmē) of the conclusion.  Posterior Analytics 1.2, 71b9-12 (Barnes tr.)\nWe think we understand (= know scientifically) a thing simpliciter (and not in the sophistic fashion accidentally) whenever we think we are aware both that the explanation [10] because of which the object is is its explanation, and that it is not possible for this to be otherwise.\n   The syllogistic is a necessary preliminary to the study of demonstration and demonstrative scientific knowledge \u0026ldquo;because syllogism is more universal than demonstration, for a demonstration is a kind of syllogism, but not every syllogism is a demonstration\u0026rdquo; (APr. 1.4, 28\u0026ndash;31)\nAs the universal patterns of which demonstrations are special instances, Aristotle thinks the syllogistic implies a method for inquiry and explanation in all disciplines:\n Prior Analytics 1.30, 46a3\u0026ndash;10 (Striker tr.)\nSo the method is the same for all subjects, in philosophy as well as in the technical or mathematical disciplines. For one must discern for both terms what belongs to them and what they belong to, and be supplied with as many of those terms as possible. One must examine them with respect to the three terms, in one way when refuting, in another way when establishing something; and when it is a question of truth, from the terms that are listed as belonging truly, for dialecti- cal syllogisms from premisses according to opinion.\n   The method presupposes the classification of beings similar to the one articulated in the Categories:\n Prior Analytics 1.27, 43a25\u0026ndash;43\nNow of all the things there are:\n  some are such that they cannot be predicated truly and universally of anything else (for instance, Cleon or Callias, that is, what is individual and perceptible), but other things may be predicated of them (for each of these is both a man and an animal).\n  Some things are themselves predicated of others , but nothing else is prior and predicated of them.\n  And some things are both predicated themselves of others and others of them, as man is predicated of Callias and animal of man.\n  That [1] some things are by nature such as to be said of nothing else is clear, for just about every perceptible thing is such as not to be predicated of anything except accidentally\u0026mdash;for we do sometimes say that the white thing there is Socrates, or that what is approaching is Callias.\nBut [2] that one also comes to a halt if one goes upwards, we will explain later; for the moment let this be assumed. (APo. 1.3)\n  Now with respect to those things one cannot demonstrate that something else is predicated of them (except perhaps as a matter of mere opinion), but only that they themselves are predicated of other things;\n  nor can one demonstrate that individuals are said of other things, but only that other things are said of them. But clearly the intermediate things admit of both, for they themselves will be said of others and others of them. And by and large arguments and investigations are mostly concerned with these.\n     What of [3], the terms that are both predicated and predicated of? Aristotle continues:\n Prior Analytics 1.28 43b1\u0026ndash;11 (Striker tr.)\nSo one must select the premisses about each thing in the following way: first, set down the thing itself, its definitions, and whatever properties are peculiar to it; after that, whatever follows this thing, what is followed by it, and whatever cannot belong to the thing. (One need not select the terms to which the thing itself cannot belong, since the privative premiss converts.)\nAmong the terms that follow one must also distinguish:\n  those that are predicated in the definition,\n  those that are peculiar properties,\n  and those that are predicated as accidents; and among those, which sort is predicated only as a matter of opinion and which according to the truth.\n  For the more such terms one has available, the faster one will hit upon a conclusion, and the more these belong in truth, the more one will hit upon a demonstration.\n  Question: Which of 1\u0026ndash;3 are said-of predications, and which are present-in predications?       With a ready supply of terms, Aristotle argues (APr. 1.28) we can construct each kind of proposition (pons asinorum):\n    Commentary by Gisela Striker (2009, 195\u0026ndash;6):\n Actually, instead of building a helpful bridge, the diagram seems to make Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s rules look much more complicated than they are, because it also shows the cases in which no syllogisms can be found.\nAristotle first introduces the letters B , C, D and F, G, H to stand for sets of terms, while A and E stand for the predicate- and subject­ terms of the desired conclusion. For both A and E there will be lists of terms that either ' follow' them ( B and F ) or are followed by the m (C and G), or that cannot be predicated of them (D and H). Evidently, the terms that are said to follow a given term are universally predicable of it. The middle term in each case will be one that occurs in one of the lists for A as well as one of the lists for E. In the first example, Aristotle makes this explicit by speaking of \u0026lsquo;one of the Cs\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;one of the Fs\u0026rsquo;; later on he simply uses the letters to stand for an item on the respective list.\n Conclusions   The ontology Aristotle presents in Categories is complemented elsewhere in the Organon with a sophisticated methodology for understanding and explaining beings and their attributes. (Most notably in the Analytics, but also in the Topics.)\n  Conspicuously absent from this ontology and explanatory theory is a method for understanding and explaining change, including both changes in the attributes belonging to substances and the coming to be of substances themselves.\n(N.B., considerations of change and coming to be are not wholly absent: see especially APo. 2.12.)\n  Outside of the Organon, Aristotle will attempt to adapt this method and theory of explanation to accommodate explaining coming-to-be, but before he can do this, he has first to make conceptual sense of the phenomenon of change itself.\n  ","date":1614774480,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615808757,"objectID":"cbfca282c025f1bd807026f1fb93e61a","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit1/","publishdate":"2021-03-03T15:28:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit1/","section":"course-hylomorphism","summary":"Organon lit. \u0026ldquo;tool, instrument\u0026rdquo;; a collective name for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s logico-epistemological treatises:   Categories, on predicates\n  De Interpretatione, on things said in combination\n  Prior and Posterior Analytics, on demonstrative scientific knowledge (epistēmē apodeiktikē), including Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s categorical logic","tags":null,"title":"Unit 1 | Background: Ontology \u0026 Explanation in the Organon","type":"course-hylomorphism"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"2.1 | A Puzzle About Coming to Be  Physics 1.1, 185a13\u0026ndash;20 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nWe, on the other hand, must take for granted that the things that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in motion—which is indeed made plain by induction. Moreover, no one is bound to solve every kind of difficulty that may be [15] raised, but only as many as are drawn falsely from the principles of the science: it is not our business to refute those that do not arise in this way; just as it is the duty of the geometer to refute the squaring of the circle by means of segments, but it is not his duty to refute Antiphon’s proof. At the same time the holders of the theory of which we are speaking do incidentally raise physical questions, though nature is not their subject; so it will perhaps be as well to spend a few words on them, especially as [20] the inquiry is not without scientific interest.\n Physics I is devote to the subject of \u0026ldquo;principles\u0026rdquo; (archai pl., archē) of natural science.\n Archē beginning, origin, source (e.g. of motion)  Principle is one Either motionless\u0026hellip;    Parmenides\n [F8 ] . . . Only one tale is left of the way: that it is; and on this are posted very many signs, that [i] what-is is ungenerated and imperishable, [ii] a whole of one kind, [iii] unperturbed and [iv] complete. [i] Never was it, nor shall it be, since it now is, all together, one, continuous. For what birth would you seek of it? Where [or: how] , whence did it grow? Not from what-is-not will I allow you to say or to think; for it is not sayable or thinkable that it is not. And what need would have stirred it later or earlier, starting from nothing, to grow? Thus it must be completely or not at all. Nor ever from what-is-not will the strength of faith allow anything to come to be beside it. Wherefore neither to come to be nor to perish did Justice permit it by loosening its shackles, but she holds it fast. And the decision concerning these things comes to this: it is or it is not. Thus the decision is made, as is necessary, to leave the one way unthought, unnamed - for it is not a true way - the other to be and to be true. And how would what-is be hereafter? How would it have come to be? For if it has come to be, it is not, and similarly if it is ever about ro k Thus coming to be is quenched and perishing unheard of. [ii] Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike, nor is there any more here, which would keep it from holding together, nor any less, but it is all full of what-is. Thus it is all continuous, for what-is cleaves to what-is. [iii] Further, motionless in the limits of great bonds it is without starting and stopping, since coming to be and perishing wandered very far away, and true faith banished them. Remaining the same in the same by itself it lies and thus it remains steadfast there; for mighty Necessity holds it in the bonds of a limit, which confines it round about. [iv] Wherefore it is not right for what-is to be incomplete; for it is not needy; if it were' it would lack everything. The same thing is for thinking and is wherefore there is thought. For not without what-is, to which it is directed, will you find thought. For nothing else \u0026lt; either\u0026gt; i s nor shall be beside what-is, since Fate shackled it\n      Melissus\nWhat-is (the principle) is one, and motionless, but infinite.\n  \u0026hellip; Or in motion (\u0026ldquo;physicists\u0026rdquo;, phusiologoi)   Thales (everything is generated from water)    Anaximenes (everything is generated from air, though condensation and rarifaction)    Heraclitus (everything is fire)  Principles are more than one Anaximander All things come from to apeiron (lit., the unbounded)\nEmpedocles   One: the cosmos is in an eternal cycle of combination and separation, governed by the contrary principles Love and Strife\n  Many: everything comes about from the combination and separation of the four \u0026ldquo;roots\u0026rdquo;, earth, air, fire, and water, by Love and Strife\n   [F20] I shall speak a double tale: at one time they grew to be one alone from many, at another time it grew apart to be many from one. Double is the birth of mortal things, and double the demise; for the confluence of all things begets and destroys the one [generation] , while the other in turn, having been nurtured while things were growing apart, fled away. And these things never cease continually alternating, at one time all coming together into one by Love, at another time each being borne apart by the enmity of Strife.\n Anaxagoras  [F15] Everything else has a portion of everything, but mind is boundless, autonomous, and mixed with no object, but it is alone all by itself. If it were not by itself, but had been mixed with something else, it would have a portion of all objects, if it had been mixed with any; for there is a portion of everything in everything, as I said earlier [F12]. And the things mixed with it would hinder it from ruling any object in the way it does when it is alone by itself. For it is the finest of all objects and the purest, and it exercises complete oversight over everything and prevails above all. And all things that have soul, both the larger and the smaller, these does mind rule. And of the whole revolution did mind take control, so that it revolved in the beginning. And first it began from a small revolution, now it is revolving more, and it will revolve still more. And things mixed together, things separated, and things segregated, all these did mind comprehend. And the kinds of things that were to be - such as were but now are not, all that now are, and such as will be - all these did mind set in order, as well as this revolution, with which the stars, the sun, the moon, the air, and the aether which were being separated now revolve. For this revolution made things separate. And from the rare is separated the dense, from the cold the hot, from the dark the bright, and from the wet the dry. But there are many portions of many things. And nothing is completely separated nor segregated the one from the other except mind. Mind is all alike, both the larger and the smaller. No other thing is like anything else, but each one is and was most manifestly those things of which it has the most.\n Preliminary Results: Physics 1.5\u0026ndash;6   Coming-to-be is always between contraries.\n  Hence, the number of the principles cannot be one, since there is no contrary to one\u0026hellip;\n  So the principles are either two or three, \u0026ldquo;but whether two or three is a question of considerable difficulty\u0026rdquo;.\n  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: unit2\n2.2 | A Solution to the Puzzles Physics 1.7   Aim of the chapter: to establish \u0026ldquo;the number and nature of the principles\u0026rdquo; of coming to be (to genēsthai).\n  How? By analyzing the different ways in which things are said to come to be.\n  Analysis of Coming-to-Be  Physics 1.7, 189b32\u0026ndash;34 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nWe say that ‘one thing comes to be from another thing, and something from something different', in the case both of simple and of complex things.\n   A. distinguishes 3 ways of characterizing a single episode of coming to be.\n  \u0026ldquo;Socrates (the human being) becomes musical\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;That which is not musical becomes musical\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Non-musical Socrates becomes musical Socrates\u0026rdquo;\n    First Pass:\n  In (1) and (2), both \u0026ldquo;that which becomes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;what it becomes\u0026rdquo; are simple.\n  In (3), both \u0026ldquo;that which becomes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;what it becomes\u0026rdquo; are complex (or combined, sunkeitai)\n        \u0026ldquo;That Which Becomes\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What It Becomes\u0026rdquo;     Simple Socrates Musical   Simple The Non-Musical Musical   \u0026ldquo;Combined\u0026rdquo; Non-Musical Socrates Musical Socrates     Simple cases, in detail:   Physics 1.7, 190a9\u0026ndash;13 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nWhen a simple thing is said to become something, in one case it survives [10] through the process, in the other it does not. For the man remains a man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas what is not musical or is unmusical does not survive, either simply or combined with the subject.\n  Question In which simple case of coming-to-be does \u0026ldquo;that which becomes\u0026rdquo; survive (lit., \u0026ldquo;remain, persist\u0026rdquo;; hupomenon)?  Answer: - Socrates survives coming to be musical.\n- **The Non-Musical** does not survive coming to be musical.  Two Conditions on Coming to Be  Physics 1.7, 190a13\u0026ndash;21 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nThese distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various cases of becoming in the way we are describing that there must always be an underlying [15] something, namely that which becomes, and that this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one. (By ‘in form’ I mean the same as ‘in account’.)\u0026hellip;\nOne part survives, the other does not: what is not an opposite survives (for the man survives), but [20] not-musical or unmusical does not survive, nor does the compound of the two, namely the unmusical man.\n  Subject Condition (SC) In every case of coming to be, there must be some underlying subject, s, such that it is true \u0026lsquo;s comes to be\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;. Persistance Condition (PC) In every case of coming to be, the underlying subject must remain one in number, although not one in form or logos.  Cf. Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of numerical unity in Metaphysics Δ:     Metaphysics Δ 6, 1017a30\u0026ndash;34 (Ross tr.)\nAgain, some things are one in number, others in species, others in genus, others by analogy; in number those whose matter is one, in species [= form] those whose formula is one, in genus those to which the same figure of predication applies, by analogy those which are related as a third thing is to a fourth.\n Varieties of Coming to Be  Things are said to come to be in different ways. In some cases we do not use the expression ‘come to be’, but ‘come to be so-and-so’. Only substances are said to come to be without qualification.\n  Qualified Coming to Be s comes to be F (for some predicable F in a non-substance category) Unqualified Coming to Be s comes to be (or: s comes to be an F, for some kind of substance F)  Applying SC and PC  Subject Condition applies to both qualified and unqualified coming to be.   Physics 1.7, 190a33\u0026ndash;b5 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nNow in all cases other than substance it is plain that there must be something underlying, namely, that which becomes. For when a thing comes to be of such a quantity or quality or in such a relation, time, or place, a subject is always [35] presupposed, since substance alone is not predicated of another subject, but everything else of substance.\nBut that substances too, and anything that can be said to be without [190 b 1] qualification, come to be from some underlying thing, will appear on examination. For we find in every case something that underlies from which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals and plants from seed.\n  Question What about PC?  Qualified Coming to Be: Of course! It is the substance, or tode ti:     Physics 1.7, 190b24\u0026ndash;28 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nNow the subject is one numerically, though it is two in form. (For there is the man, the gold—in general, the countable matter; for it is more of the nature of a [25] ‘this’, and what comes to be does not come from it accidentally; the privation, on the other hand, and the contrariety are accidental.)\n  Unqualified Coming to Be The \u0026ldquo;matter\u0026rdquo; of substance/subject of unqualified coming to be is knowable on analogy to the matter of qualified comings to be:   Physics 1.7, 191a9\u0026ndash;12 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nThe underlying nature can be known by analogy. For as the bronze is to the [10] statue, the wood to the bed, or the matter and the formless before receiving form to any thing which has form, so is the underlying nature to substance, i.e. the ‘this’ or existent.\n  Initial formulation of matter:   Physics 1.9, 192a31\u0026ndash;33 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nFor my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be, and which persists in the result, not accidentally.\n Resolution to the Puzzle  All coming to be is complex in that which comes to be:   Physics 1.7, 190b11\u0026ndash;15 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nThus, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is always complex. There is, on the one hand, something which comes to be, and again something which becomes that—the latter in two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the opposite I mean the unmusical, by the subject, man; and similarly I call the absence of shape or form or order the opposite, and the bronze or stone or gold the [15] subject.\n   What comes to be is the Form (morphē), e.g. Musical\n  What comes to be is always a \u0026ldquo;compound\u0026rdquo; (suntheton) involving:\n  The Subject (hupokeimenon), e.g. Socrates\n  The Opposite or Privation, e.g. Non-Musical\n    Hence, there are (depending on how one describes the coming to be) either two or three principles:\n   Physics 1.7, 190b29\u0026ndash;191a2 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nThere is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the contraries are the [30] principles—say for example the musical and the unmusical, the hot and the cold, the tuned and the untuned—and a sense in which they are not, since it is impossible for the contraries to be acted on by each other. But this difficulty also is solved by the fact that what underlies is different from the contraries; for it is itself not a [35] contrary. The principles therefore are, in a way, not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two; nor yet precisely two, since there is a difference of [191 a 1] being, but three. For to be man is different from to be unmusical, and to be unformed from to be bronze.\n Physics 1.8  Aim of the chapter to show that only this analysis of coming to be can solve \u0026ldquo;the difficulty of the early thinkers, as well as our own\u0026rdquo;.  A Dilemmatic Argument  Physics 1.8, 191a25\u0026ndash;31 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nThe first of those who studied philosophy \u0026hellip; say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible.\nFor what is cannot come to be [30] (because it is already), and\nfrom what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must be underlying).\n   If x comes to be, it must come to be either\n  from what is, or\n  from what is not.\n    x cannot come to be from what is, since what-is already is\n  x cannot come to be from what-is-not, since something must be underlying (SC, no generation ex nihilo)\n  Therefore, it is not the case that x comes to be.\n  The Aristotelian Intervention Distinguish (1) coming to be from what is not without qualification (which is impossible) from (2) coming to be from what is not-F, where F is incidental to what something comes to be from:\n A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor, but qua housebuilder, and turns gray, not qua [5] doctor, but qua dark-haired. On the other hand he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we are using words most appropriately when we say that a doctor does something or undergoes something, or becomes something from being a doctor, if he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor. Clearly then also to come to be so-and-so from what is not means ‘qua what is not’.\n  The Qua Operator x does φ qua F iff x does φ in x\u0026rsquo;s capacity as (an) F  Responding to the Dilemma    Disarming the Second Horn\nRecall: that which comes to be is complex, including both subject (which survives as a constituent of that which comes to be) and privation (which is something which is not and does not survive).\n Physics 1.8, 191b13\u0026ndash;17 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nWe ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless we maintain that a thing may come to be from what is not in a qualified sense, i.e. accidentally. For a [15] thing comes to be from the privation, which in its own nature is something which is not—this not surviving as a constituent of the result. Yet this causes surprise, and it is thought impossible that something should come to be in the way described from what is not.\n      Disarming the First Horn\nRecall: the subject in every case comes to be F from being not-F:\n Physics 1.8, 191b17\u0026ndash;25 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nIn the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from what is, and that what is does not come to be except accidentally. In that way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus, suppose a dog to come to be from a dog, or a horse [20] from a horse. The dog would then, it is true, come to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a certain kind) but not as animal, for that is already there. But if anything is to become an animal, not accidentally, it will not be from animal; and if what is, not from what is—nor from what is not either, for it has been explained that [25] by ‘from what is not’ we mean qua what is not.\n   Lingering Questions  Details of Unqualified Coming to Be What is the subject of substantial generation? What is the relevant privation? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it the case that substances lacks contraries (Cat. 5)? A Puzzling Reference A. claims that the same dilemma has been solved elsewhere in terms of potentiality (dunamis) and actuality (energeia). Where, and how?   Physics 1.8, 191b27\u0026ndash;29 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nThis then is one way of solving the difficulty. Another consists in pointing out that the same things can be spoken of in terms of potentiality and actuality. But this has been done with greater precision elsewhere.\n 2.3 | Substantial vs. Non-Substantial Coming to Be Basic Notions Kinds of Coming to Be/Passing Away  Coming-to-be/generation to genēsthai, genesis Passing away/corruption phthora  Cf.

The Tasks of GC 1.1\u0026ndash;4  GC 1.1, 314a1\u0026ndash;5 (Williams tr.)\nOur task now is:\n to pick out the causes and definitions of generation and corruption common to all those things which come to be and perish in the course of nature; and secondly to investigate growth and alteration, asking what each of them is, and whether we are to suppose that the nature of alteration and generation is the same or different, as they are certainly distinguished in name.     GC 1.1\u0026ndash;3 are concerned principally with Task 1, specifically with articulating a basic account of unqualified generation and corruption\n  GC 1.4\u0026ndash;5 are concerned principally with Task 2, distinguishing unqualified generation from both alteration and growth\n  Why is Task 2 so pressing?\n  As A. tells us at the end of GC 1.2:\n   GC 1.2 317a17\u0026ndash;26 (Williams tr.)\nNevertheless, coming to be simpliciter, i.e. absolutely, is not defined by aggregation and segregation, as some say; nor is change in what is continuous the same as alteration. This is just where all the mistakes are made. Coming to be and ceasing to be simpliciter occur, not in virtue of aggregation and segregation, but when something changes from this to that as a whole. These people think that all such change is alteration, but there is in fact a distinction. For within the substratum there is something which corresponds to the definition and something which corresponds to the matter. When, therefore, the change takes place in these it will be generation or corruption: when it takes place in the affections, accidentally, it will be alteration.\n The Basic Model of Generation in GC 1.1\u0026ndash;3 Answers 2 questions:\n What is generation/corruption without qualification (or absolutely, or simpliciter)? Why is it that some coming to be is absolute, while some is not?   GC 1.3, 317b12\u0026ndash;34 (Williams tr.)\nThe dilemmas that arise concerning these matters and their solutions have been set out at greater length elsewhere, but it should now again be said by way of summary that in one way it is from what is not that a thing comes to be simpliciter, though in another way it is always from what is; for that which is potentially but is not actually must pre-exist, being described in both these ways.\nBut even when these distinctions have been made, there remains a question of remarkable difficulty, which we must take up once again, namely, how is coming to be simpliciter possible, whether from what is potentially or some other way. One might well wonder whether there is coming to be of substance and the individual, as opposed to quality, quantity, and place (and the same question arises in the case of ceasing to be). For if something comes to be, clearly there will exist potentially, not actually, some substance from which the coming to be will arise and into which that which ceases to be has to change. Now will any of the others belong to this actually?\nWhat I mean is: Will that which is only potentially individual and existent, but neither individual nor existent simpliciter, have any quality or quanity or place?\n  If it has none of these, but all of them potentially, (a) that which in this sense is not will consequently be separable, and further, (b) the principal and perpetual fear of the early philosophers will be realized, namely, the coming to be of something from nothing previously existing.\n  But if being individual and a substance are not going to belong to it while some of the other things we have mentioned are, the affections will, as we have remarked, be separable from the substances.\n    If there is unqualified generation/corruption, why does it persist? Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t the total quantity of bodies continually shrink into non-existence?   GC 1.3, 318b33\u0026ndash;319a3 (Williams tr.)\nWe have now stated the reason why there is such a thing as generation simpliciter, which is the corruption of something, and such a thing as corruption simpliciter, which is the generation of something: it is due to a difference of matter:\n either in respect of its being substance or not being substance, or in respect of its being more or less so, or because in the one case the matter from which or to which the change takes place is more perceptible and in the other case less perceptible.    Question How does this account of absolute generation apply to the transformation of the elements?  Distinguishing Absolute Generation from Alteration (GC 1.4)  GC 1.4, 319b8\u0026ndash;21 (Williams tr.)\nThe substratum is one thing and the affection whose nature is to be predicated of the substratum another, and either of them can change.\n Alteration So it is alteration when the substratum remains, being something perceptible [i.e., a tode ti or individual] but change occurs in the affections which belong to it, whether these are contraries or intermediates. For example, the body is well then ill, but remains the same body; the bronze is now round, now a thing with corners, but remains the same [sc. bronze]. Generation When, however, the whole changes without anything perceptible remaining as the same substratum, but the way:  the seed changes entirely into blood, water into air, or air entirely into water,  then, when we have this sort of thing, it is a case of generation (and corrpution of something else); particularly if the change takes place from what is imperceptible to what is perceptible either by touch or by the other senses, as when water is generated or corrupts into air, since air is\u0026mdash;near enough\u0026mdash;imperceptible.\n  In these cases [sc. of generation] if some affection that is one of a pair of contraries remains the same in the thing generated as it was in the thing that has perished, e.g. when water comes from air, if both are transparent or \u0026lt;wet, but not\u0026gt; cold, this must not have the other, the terminus of the change, as an affection of itself. Otherwise it will be alteration.\n   The Unqualified Nature of Elemental Transformations  GC 1.4, 319b21\u0026ndash;31 (RFH rough tr.)\nἘν δὲ τούτοις ἄν τι ὑπομένῃ πάθος τὸ αὐτὸ ἐναντιώ σεως ἐν τῷ γενομένῳ καὶ τῷ φθαρέντι, οἷον ὅταν ἐξ ἀέρος ὕδωρ, εἰ ἄμφω διαφανῆ ἢ ψυχρά, οὐ δεῖ τούτου θάτερον πάθος εἶναι εἰς ὃ μεταβάλλει. Εἰ δὲ μή, ἔσται ἀλλοίωσις, [25] οἷον ὁ μουσικὸς ἄνθρωπος ἐφθάρη, ἄνθρωπος δ' ἄμουσος ἐγέ- νετο, ὁ δ' ἄνθρωπος ὑπομένει τὸ αὐτό.\nΕἰ μὲν οὖν τούτου μὴ πάθος ἦν καθ' αὑτὸ ἡ μουσικὴ καὶ ἡ ἀμουσία, τοῦ μὲν γένε- σις ἦν ἄν, τοῦ δὲ φθορά· διὸ ἀνθρώπου μὲν ταῦτα πάθη, ἀνθρώπου δὲ μουσικοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπου ἀμούσου γένεσις καὶ [30] φθορά· νῦν δὲ πάθος τοῦτο τοῦ ὑπομένοντος. Διὸ ἀλλοίωσις τὰ τοιαῦτα.\n[I] In those things in which some affection from among a pair of contraries remains the same in both what comes to be and what is destroyed\u0026mdash;for instance, when water [comes to be] from air, assuming both are transparent or cold [moist?]\u0026mdash;the other, into which it changes, must not be an affection of it. If it is, it will be [a case of] alteration, as [when] the musical person perishes and the unmusical person comes to be, the person remains the same.\n[II] Hence if musical and unmusical were not per se affections of this [sc. the person], we would have generation of the latter and passing away of the former. This is why they are affections of a person, whereas of musical person and unmusical person we have generation and destruction. As it is, however, this is an affection of what remains, for which reason [transformations] of this sort are [cases of] alteration.\n  Upshot of [I] On pain of being cases of alteration, it cannot be supposed that the persisting subject of elemental transformations is the quality that inheres in both what comes to be and what perishes. Upshot of [II] Despite the superficial similarity in the locutions (1) \u0026ldquo;the musical person comes to be the unmusical person\u0026rdquo; and (2) \u0026ldquo;the hot moist comes to be the cold moist\u0026rdquo;, they describe two ontologically distinct changes:   In (1), the affections musical and unmusical are affections of the person as such, which therefore persists through the alteration as subject.\n  In (2), however, the affections hot and cold are affections of the moist only incidentally, in the way the pale thing (the person who happens to be pale) is musical or unmusical. Hence it is wrong to suppose that the moist is a subject of predication, much less that it persists through the transition from hot to cold.\n    Two Interpretive Strategies (Pros and Cons)  Question What, if anything, is the subject of which moist, hot, and cold are predicated?   First air, then water: Coheres with A.\u0026rsquo;s denial of a persistent subject in unqualified generation, but at the cost of treating elemental transformation (and all substantial coming-to-be) as a process of \u0026ldquo;sheer replacement\u0026rdquo;.\n  Prime matter: Avoids the \u0026ldquo;sheer replacement\u0026rdquo; model, and perhaps enjoys some textual support, but the metaphysical victory is pyrrhic: what sort of improvement is it to say that water comes to be from pure potentiality?\n    ","date":1615467600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617257889,"objectID":"1093e4b4cc8ee6687d472fa7a8e0cca6","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit2/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T16:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit2/","section":"course-hylomorphism","summary":"2.1 | A Puzzle About Coming to Be  Physics 1.1, 185a13\u0026ndash;20 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nWe, on the other hand, must take for granted that the things that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in motion—which is indeed made plain by induction.","tags":null,"title":"Unit 2 | Aristotle's Argument for Hylomorphism","type":"course-hylomorphism"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"3.1 | Nature \u0026amp; Causation The unity of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Physics is a matter of scholarly controversy, but it seems clear that Physics 2\u0026ndash;4 (at least) constitute a continuous discussion of nature (phusis). Physics 2 provides the foundation of this discussion, defending a definition of nature as well as an enumeration of the kinds of cause operative in the things that come about by or in accordance with nature.\nA Division Among Beings Physics 2.1 begins with a distinction among beings (ta onta):\n Physics 2.1, 192b8\u0026ndash;23 (RFH quasi-literal translation)\nAmong the things that are (ta onta), some are by nature (phusei), while others are due to other causes (aitia). By nature are animals and their parts; plants; and simple bodies like earth, fire, air, and water (for we say that these and things like them are by nature); and all of these plainly differ from those things which are not constituted by nature. For each of these [which are constituted by nature] has in itself a principle (archē) of change and rest, some [a principle of change] in respect of place, some in respect of growth and decay, and some in respect of alteration.\nBy contrast, a bed, or cloak, or anything else of that sort does not have an innate impulse for change, [at least] not qua satisfying these descriptions and to the extent that they are products of craft (technē). However, insofar as they are made of stone or earth, or a mixture of the two, to that extent they do [have an innate impulse for change], since nature is a kind of principle and cause of changing and resting in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not accidentally.\n  Here Aristotle divides ta onta (exhaustively?) into two kinds:   Those that are (what they are) by nature, which, as the sort of things they are, have an internal causal principle of change and rest.\n  Those that are (what they are) not by nature, which do not, as the sort of things they are, have an internal causal principle of change and rest, but come about from other causes (e.g., craft).\n    Nature as a Principle of Change What distinguishes things that are by nature from things that are due to other causes (including craft) is the presence of a certain internal cause and source of change and rest, which Aristotle identifies as nature:\n Nature A causal source (principle) of change/rest internal to what it belongs to primarily in virtue of itself (per se), i.e. not accidentally.  The qualification in virtue of itself or non-accidentally refers to the connection between what is said to be \u0026ldquo;by nature\u0026rdquo; and what the nature in question is said to be predicated of:     Physics 2.1, 192b23\u0026ndash;32 (RFH quasi-literal translation)\nI mean by \u0026ldquo;not accidentally\u0026rdquo; that, for instance, although a doctor might be a cause of health in himself, he nevertheless has skill in medicine not to the extent that he is healed; rather, the doctor just happens to be the same as the person who is healed. Indeed, this is why the two [sc. doctor and patient] can be separated from one another. Circumstances are similar with each of the other things that have been made: none of them have the source of production in themselves. Rather, for some [the cause] is present in other things and comes from without, such as a house and other handmade products, while for others it is present in themselves but not in virtue of themselves\u0026mdash;whatever comes to be a cause of itself accidentally.\n Questions for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s definition:   What\u0026rsquo;s the order of explanation between the division of beings and the definition of nature? Do we take the division as given and posit the presence of nature to explain it, or is it the other way around? (Cf. 193a3 ff.: \u0026ldquo;That there is such as thing as nature would be ludicrous to try to show\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;)\n  For A., nature is a \u0026ldquo;causal principle\u0026rdquo;, both an archē and a cause (aition, aitia):\n How does nature (understood as an archē) relate to the archai of natural beings discussed in Physics 1?     Physics 2.1, 293b18\u0026ndash;21 (RFH tr.)\nNow, both form and nature are double, since privation too is in a way form. But whether or not privation and opposition of a sort are concerned with unqualified generation, we will have to inquire later.\n  How does nature operate as a cause? (Cf. Physics 2.3: cause is said in many ways\u0026hellip;)  Nature as Form and Matter One step toward answering these questions is to observe that, in Physics 2.1, A. identifies nature with both substance- and subjecthood.\nNature as Substance and Subject  Physics 2.1, 192b32\u0026ndash;34 (RFH quasi-literal translation)\nNature, then, is what we said, and everything that has such as principle has a nature. All of these, moreover, are substances (ousiai), since each is a kind of subject (hupokeimenon ti), and nature is always present in a subject.\n Nature as Matter Because all nature is present in a subject, and (as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen) matter is a subject, it is only natural to suppose that the nature of each thing corresponds to its matter.\n Physics 2.1, 193a9\u0026ndash;17 (RFH rough trans.)\nThe nature and substance of things in which nature is present seem to be that which exists primary in each, unformed in virtue of itself, [so that] for instance wood would be the nature of a bed and bronze of a statue. As a sign of this Antiphon says that if you bury a bed and the rotting wood acquired the capacity (dunamis) to send up a shoot, what would come about would not be a bed but wood, which shows that what exists accidentally is the arrangment according to convention and craft [sc. the bed], but the substance is the other [sc. the wood], which also remains continuously and suffers these [changes in arrangement].\n As A. makes clear, this line of reasoning terminates in the conclusion that the elements are the nature of things, for if wood is the nature of the bed, and wood stands (e.g.) to earth as the bed to the wood, then earth would be the nature of wood.\n Physics 2.1, 193a22\u0026ndash;28 (Charlton tr.)\nHence fire, earth, air, and water have been held to be the nature of things, some people choosing just one for this role, some several, and some making use of all. Those who fix on some such element or elements represent it or them as the entire reality, and say that other things are merely affections, states, or dispositions; and these elements are all held to be imperishable in that they do not change out of themselves, whilst other things come to be and pass away as often as you please.\n Nature as Form For A., however, nature can also refer to the form (morphē) and logos of each thing. Aristotle offers three arguments for this conclusion:\n   Analogy with the Products of Craft\n Physics 2.1, 193a28\u0026ndash;b5 (Charlton tr.)\nThat is one way of using the word \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo;: for\n  the primary underlying matter in each case, of things which have in themselves a source of their movements and changes.\n  It is also used for the shape and form which accords with a thing\u0026rsquo;s account.\n  [Argument for 2] Just as that which is in accordance with art and artificial is called art, so that which is in accordance with nature and natural is called nature. And as in the one case we would not yet say that a thing is at all in accordance with art, or that it is [in accordance with] art, if it is a bed only in possibility, and has not yet the form of a bed, so with things constituted naturally: that which is flesh or bone only in possibility, before it acquires the form which accords with the account by which we define what flesh or bone is, does not yet have its proper nature, and is not a thing due to nature. So there is another way of speaking, according to which nature is the shape and form of things which have in themselves a source of their changes, something which is not separable except in respect of its account.\n The argument proceeds as follows:\nP1 : We use \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; in the same way that we use \u0026ldquo;art\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;craft\u0026rdquo;, technē)\nP2 : We say things are (what they are) in accordance with art only when they actually possess the form imposed on them by the relevant art. - Example: Wood that is potentially a bed is not yet in accordance with art; only when it actually has the form of a bed.\nC : So, by analogy, we say things are (what they are) in accordance with nature only when they actually possess \u0026ldquo;the form which accords with the account by which we define\u0026rdquo; what it is. - Example: What is potentially flesh or bone is not yet in accordance with nature [= the nature of flesh/bone?]; only when it actually has the relevant form.\n     Parity of Reasoning\nAs A. suggests in the previous argument, nature is also \u0026ldquo;the shape and form of things which have in themselves a source of their changes, something which is not separable except in respect of its account\u0026rdquo; (on which see Physics 2.2). With the next argument, A. begins to make clear in what sense form can operate as a source of change.\nThe argument attempts to argue by parity of reasoning with Antiphon\u0026rsquo;s bed argument earlier in the chapter:\n Physics 2.1, 193b8\u0026ndash;12 (RFH tr.)\nFurthermore, a human comes to be from a human, but not a bed from a bed. This is also why people say the shape is not nature but rather the wood, because if it grew it would not be a bed that came to be but wood. Hence if this is nature, so too must the form be nature, since human comes from human.\n      Nature as End of Change\nIn different ways, then, both nature-as-form and nature-as-matter seem to have a causal role in the origin and source of natural changes. Additionally, nature-as-form has a role to play as the end towards which a natural change proceeds:\n Physics 2.1, 193b\u0026ndash;18 (RFH tr.)\nFurthermore, nature spoken of as coming-to-be is a path into nature (hodos eis phusis). This is not like the practice of medicine, which is said to be a path, not into medicine, but to health. The reason is that the practice of medicine must not proceed to medicine, but from it, whereas nature does not stand to nature in this way. To the contrary, what grows, qua growing, proceeds from something into something. What, then, is it that grows? It is not that from which, but rather that into which, it grows. Therefore form is nature.\n Note : \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; (phusis) derives from the Greek word for \u0026ldquo;grow\u0026rdquo; (phuein).\nA. makes this point a bit more clearly in Physics 2.2:\n 194a28\u0026ndash;33 (RFH rough tr.)\nNature is an end (telos) and that for the sake of which (hou heneka), for when in a continuous change there is some end, this [sc. the end] is the last and that for the sake of which. For this reason too the poet was ridiculous to say \u0026ldquo;he has reached the end for whose sake he was born\u0026rdquo;. For not everything which is last should be considered the end, but rather the best.\n   Nature as Cause For A., then, nature, understood as a principle of change, is \u0026ldquo;double\u0026rdquo; (dichōs), both form and matter. The two senses, however, are not equal, since for A. form must be considered more nature than matter:\n 193b6\u0026ndash;8 (RFH tr.)\nThis [sc. form, morphē?] is nature rather than the matter. For each thing is more property said [to be what it is] when it is actually, rather than potentially.\n How is this double conception of nature reflected in A.\u0026rsquo;s idea that nature is a kind of cause? To answer this question, we need to turn to Physics 2.3, where A. outlines the different ways in which things are said to be a cause (aitios, aition):\n Physics 2.3, 194b23\u0026ndash;195a3 (Charlton tr.)\n  According to one way of speaking, that out of which as a constituent a thing comes to be is called a cause; for example, the bronze and the silver and their genera would be the causes respectively of a statue and a loving-cup.\n  According to another, the form or model is a cause; this is the account of what the being would be, and its genera—thus the cause of an octave is the ratio of two to one, and more generally number—and the parts which come into the account.\n  Again, there is the primary source of the change or the staying unchanged: for example, the man who has deliberated is a cause, the father is a cause of the child, and in general that which makes something of that which is made, and that which changes something of that which is changed.\n  And again, a thing may be a cause as the end. That is what something is for, as health might be what a walk is for. On account of what does he walk? We answer \u0026lsquo;To keep fit\u0026rsquo; and think that, in saying that, we have given the cause. And anything which, the change being effected by something else, comes to be on the way to the end, as slimness, purging, drugs, and surgical instruments come to be as means to health: all these are for the end, but differ in that the former are works [or functions, erga ] and the latter tools [ organa ].\n   How nature-as-form and nature-as-matter map on to the notion of cause in these senses is an important question for the remainder of Physics 2. We\u0026rsquo;ll pick up with it next Thursday, and then again next week.\n3.2 | Necessity \u0026amp; Teleology Review  Physics 2.1 Nature is an internal causal principle of change and rest in that which is by nature primarily and non-accidentally. Question What kind of causal principle? Answer It\u0026rsquo;s complicated\u0026hellip;   Physics 2.1\u0026ndash;2: Nature is \u0026ldquo;double\u0026rdquo;, both formal and material.\n  Physics 2.3: \u0026ldquo;Cause\u0026rdquo; is said in many ways: formal, material, efficient, and final.\n    Drawing Conclusions In Physics 2.7 A. consolidates some of these conclusions:\n Physics 2.7, 198a22\u0026ndash;31 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nNow, the causes being four, it is the business of the student of nature to know about them all, and if he refers his problems back to all of them, he will assign the ‘why’ in the way proper to his science—the matter, the form, the mover, that for the [25] sake of which. The last three often coincide; for the what and that for the sake of which are one, while the primary source of motion is the same in species as these. For man generates man—and so too, in general, with all things which cause movement by being themselves moved; and such as are not of this kind are no longer inside the province of natural science, for they cause motion not by possessing motion or a source of motion in themselves, but being themselves incapable of [30] motion.\n   The form, mover, and that for the sake of which are, in many cases, operations of formal nature in natural substances.\n  Notice, however, that matter too can operate as a source of motion, as when we say that something is heated due to the presence of fire. In natural substances (a plant or animal, say) these sorts of efficient causes cannot directly be attributed to formal nature but rather material nature. How do these two types of cause interact in nature?\n  Answering this question is the topic of Physics 2.8\u0026ndash;9, which Aristotle devotes to arguing for two claims:\n  Physics 2.8: That \u0026ldquo;nature belongs to the class of causes that act for the sake of something\u0026rdquo; (198b9\u0026ndash;10)\n  Physics 2.9: The place of (material) necessity in nature, \u0026ldquo;for all writers ascribe things to this cause, arguing that since the hot and the cold and the like are of such and such a kind, therefore certain things necessarily are and come to be—and if they mention any other cause (one friendship and strife, [15] another mind), it is only to touch on it, and then good-bye to it\u0026rdquo; (198b10\u0026ndash;15).\n    Nature as a Final Cause  Observation Some things in nature do not happen for the sake of anything, even though it benefits something.   Even if the farmer benefits from the rain, it does not rain for the sake of making the corn grow.\n  Even if the tourism industry in Antalya benefits from sunny summer weather, the weather is not sunny for the sake of the tourism industry.\n   Question Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t all natural processes happen this way?   Physics 2.8, 16\u0026ndash;32 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nA difficulty presents itself: why should not nature work, not for the sake of something, nor because it is better so, but just as the sky rains, not in order to make the corn grow, but of necessity? (What is drawn up must cool, and what has been cooled must become water and descend, the result of this being that the corn grows.) [20] Similarly if a man’s crop is spoiled on the threshing-floor, the rain did not fall for the sake of this—in order that the crop might be spoiled—but that result just followed. Why then should it not be the same with the parts in nature, e.g. that our teeth should come up of necessity—the front teeth sharp, fitted for tearing, the [25] molars broad and useful for grinding down the food—since they did not arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with all other parts in which we suppose that there is purpose? Wherever then all the parts came about just what they would have been if they had come to be for an end, such things survived, being [30] organized spontaneously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish, as Empedocles says his ‘man-faced oxprogeny’ did.\n Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Principal Argument for Natural Teleology  Physics 2.8, 198b32\u0026ndash;199a8\nYet it is impossible that this should be the true view. For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or for the most part come about in a given way; but of not one of the results of chance or spontaneity is this true. We do not [199a1] ascribe to chance or mere coincidence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows [5] that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature.\n    A (very) rough reconstruction.\nP1 : For any product of nature, o, either o comes about by chance or o comes about for the sake of something.\nP2 : If o comes about by nature, then o comes about (in the way it does) either always or for the most part (i.e. if nothing external interferes).\nP3 : Nothing that happens always or for the most part comes about by chance.\nC : So, if o comes about by nature, then o comes about for the sake of something.\n     Supplement: Aristotle on Chance\nA. here seems to be relying on Physics 2.4\u0026ndash;6, which argued that chance and spontaneity are distinct sorts of cause, in particular on this observation:\n Physics 2.5, 196b1\u0026ndash;16 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nFirst then we observe that some things always come to pass in the same [10] way, and others for the most part. It is clearly of neither of these that chance, or the result of chance, is said to be the cause—neither of that which is by necessity and always, nor of that which is for the most part. But as there is a third class of events besides these two—events which all say are by chance—it is plain that there is such [15] a thing as chance and spontaneity; for we know that things of this kind are due to chance and that things due to chance are of this kind.\n Aristotle reiterates this observation in Physics 2.8 (199b16\u0026ndash;26, Hardie and Gaye tr.)\n For those things are natural which, by a continuous movement originated from an internal principle, arrive at some end: the same end is not reached from every principle; nor any chance end, but always the tendency in each is towards the same end, if there is no impediment.\nThe end and the means towards it may come about by chance. We say, for instance, that a stranger has come by chance, paid the ransom, and gone away, [20] when he does so as if he had come for that purpose, though it was not for that that he came. This is accidental, for chance is an accidental cause, as I remarked before. But when an event takes place always or for the most part, it is not accidental or by [25] chance. In natural products the sequence is invariable, if there is no impediment.\n      Questions for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Argument\nMight not A. be begging the question against his opponents? (More on this Thursday)\n  The Craft Analogy Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s conception of natural teleology relies on an important analogy with art (or craft, technē), which in his view always operates:\n Either to bring to completion what nature has not finished, or Imitates nature.   Physics 2.8, 199a17\u0026ndash;18\nIf, therefore, artificial products are for the sake of an end, so clearly are natural products.\n For Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s the analogy is strict: apart from the fact that the causes of artificial products are external to the products themselves, art and nature are purposive in the same way:\n Physics 2.8, 199b26\u0026ndash;30 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nIt is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present because we do not observe the agent deliberating. Art does not deliberate. If the ship-building art were in the wood, it would produce the same results by nature. If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature. The best illustration is a doctor doctoring himself: [30] nature is like that.\n Two Kinds of Necessity   In Physics 2.8, Aristotle associated form with \u0026ldquo;the cause in the sense of that for the sake of which\u0026rdquo; (199a30\u0026ndash;33).\n  In Physics 2.9, when Aristotle turns to the role of necessity (anankē) in nature, he argues for a subordinate causal role for material nature in natural processes.\n  To do so, however, he has to clarify the sense in which it is true to say that things happen necessarily in nature. Again he relies on an analogy with craft:\n   Physics 2.9, 199b33\u0026ndash;200a14 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nThe current view places what is of necessity in the process of production, just as if one were to suppose that the wall of a house [200a1] necessarily comes to be because what is heavy is naturally carried downwards and what is light to the top, so that the stones and foundations take the lowest place, with earth above because it is lighter, and wood at the top of all as being the lightest. Whereas, though the wall does not come to be without these, it is not due to these, [5] except as its material cause: it comes to be for the sake of sheltering and guarding certain things.\nSimilarly in all other things which involve that for the sake of which: the product cannot come to be without things which have a necessary nature, but it is not due to these (except as its material); it comes to be for an end. For instance, why is a saw such as it is? To effect so-and-so and for the sake of so-and-so. This [10] end, however, cannot be realized unless the saw is made of iron. It is, therefore, necessary for it to be of iron, if we are to have a saw and perform the operation of sawing. What is necessary then, is necessary on a hypothesis, not as an end. Necessity is in the matter, while that for the sake of which is in the definition.\n  Observation It seems that we can explain a number of natural processes by focusing only on the necessary (efficient causal) effects of matter, e.g. heatings and coolings, hardenings and softenings, etc. Question Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this make the role of formal nature as a final cause redundant? Answer No! All that happens \u0026ldquo;of necessity\u0026rdquo; in these natural processes is conditional on a hypothesis, namely: that there is to be an F.   Physics 2.9, 200a24\u0026ndash;29 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)\nIf then there is to be a house, such-and-such things must be made or be there already or exist, or generally [25] the matter relative to the end, bricks and stones if it is a house. But the end is not due to these except as the matter, nor will it come to exist because of them. Yet if they do not exist at all, neither will the house, or the saw—the former in the absence of stones, the latter in the absence of iron\u0026hellip;\n Cause sine qua non (without which not).\n3.3 | A Hylomorphic Model of Animal Generation GC 2.9 | Return to the Number and Nature of the Principles of Coming-to-Be  Physics 1.7 The principles of coming to be are three - form, privation, and subject. Physics 2.1 These principles can be consigned to matter (subject) and form (form and privation). GC 2.9 There is a third principle \u0026ldquo;present over and above\u0026rdquo; matter and form\u0026hellip;  GC 2.9, 335a28\u0026ndash;32 (Joachim tr.)\nThe principles, then, are equal in number to, and identical in kind with, those in the sphere of the eternal and primary things. For there is one in the sense of matter, and a second in the sense of form; and, in addition, the third must be present [30] as well. For the two are not sufficient to bring things into being, any more than they are adequate to account for the primary things.\n   Against \u0026ldquo;Purely Material\u0026rdquo; Explanations of Generation 3 Problems:\n   Matter is passive\n GC 2.9, 335b30\u0026ndash;34 (Joachim tr.)\nFor, to begin with, it is characteristic of matter to suffer action, i.e. to be moved; but to move, i.e. to act, belongs to a different power. This is obvious both in the things that come-to-be by art and in those that come-to-be by nature. Water does not of itself produce out of itself an animal; and it is the art, not the wood, that makes a bed.\n      \u0026ldquo;Omits the more controlling cause\u0026rdquo;\n GC 2.9, 335b34\u0026ndash;5 (Joachim tr.)\nNor is this their only error. They make a second mistake in omitting the more controlling cause; for they eliminate the essential nature, i.e. the form.\n      Mistakes instruments used by the cause for the cause itself\n GC 2.9, 336a1\u0026ndash;14 (Joachim tr.)\nAnd what is more, since they remove the formal cause, they invest the forces they assign to the simple bodies—the forces which enable these bodies to bring things into being—with too instrumental a character. For since (as they say) it is the nature of the hot to dissociate, of the cold to bring together, and of each remaining [5] contrary either to act or to suffer action, it is out of such materials and by their agency (so they maintain) that everything else comes-to-be and passes-away. Yet it is evident that even Fire is itself moved, i.e. suffers action.\nMoreover their procedure is virtually the same as if one were to treat the saw (and the various instruments of [10] carpentry) as the cause of the things that come-to-be; for the wood must be divided if a man saws, must become smooth if he planes, and so on with the remaining tools. Hence, however true it may be that Fire is active, i.e. sets things moving, there is a further point they fail to observe—viz. that Fire is inferior to the tools or instruments in the manner in which it sets things moving.\n   Against \u0026ldquo;Purely Formal\u0026rdquo; Explanations of Generation    The view\nSocrates \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; hypothesis regarding \u0026ldquo;the cause of generation and destruction\u0026rdquo;:\n Plato, Phaedo 100d\u0026ndash;101d (Grube tr.)\nI no longer understand or recognize those other sophisticated causes, and if someone tells me that a thing is beautiful because it has a bright color or shape or any such thing, I ignore these other reasons—for all these confuse me—but I simply, naively and perhaps foolishly cling to this, that nothing else makes it beautiful other than the presence of, or the sharing in, or however you may describe its relationship to that Beautiful we mentioned, for I will not insist on the precise nature of the relationship, but that all beautiful things are beautiful by the Beautiful. That, I think, is the safest answer I can give myself or anyone else. And if I stick to this I think I shall never fall into error. This is the safe answer for me or anyone else to give, namely, that it is through Beauty that beautiful things are made beautiful. Or do you not think so too?—I do.\n\u0026hellip;\nThen would you not avoid saying that when one is added to one it is the addition and when it is divided it is the division that is the cause of two? And you would loudly exclaim that you do not know how else each thing can come to be except by sharing in the particular reality in which it shares, and in these cases you do not know of any other cause of becoming two except by sharing in Twoness, and that the things that are to be two must share in this, as that which is to be one must share in Oneness, and you would dismiss these additions and divisions and other such subtleties, and leave them to those wiser than yourself to answer.\n      Objections to the view\n   The \u0026ldquo;intermittancy\u0026rdquo; of generation\n GC 2.9, 335b18\u0026ndash;20 (Joachim tr.)\nFor if the Forms are causes, why is their generating activity intermittent instead of perpetual and continuous—since there always are participants as well as Forms?\n      Ignores other causes\n GC 2.9, 335b20\u0026ndash;24 (Joachim tr.)\nBesides, in some instances we see [20] that the cause is other than the Form. For it is the doctor who implants health and the man of science who implants science, although Health itself and Science itself are as well as the participants; and the same principle applies to everything else that is produced in accordance with a capacity.\n     The Third Principle  GC 2.9, 335a33\u0026ndash;b8\nNow cause, in the sense of matter, for the things which are such as to come-to-be is that which can be and not be; and this is identical with that which can come to be and pass away, since the latter, while it is at one time, at another time is not. (For whereas some things are of necessity, viz. the eternal things, others of necessity are not. And of these two sets of things, since they cannot diverge from the [335b1] necessity of their nature, it is impossible for the first not to be and impossible for the second to be. Other things, however, can both be and not be.) Hence coming-to-be and passing-away must occur within the field of that which can be and not be.\nThis, therefore, is cause in the sense of matter for the things which are such as to [5] come-to-be; while cause, in the sense of their end, is their figure or form—and that is the formula expressing the substance of each of them.\nBut the third principle must be present as well—the cause vaguely dreamed of by all our predecessors, definitely stated by none of them.\n Strangely, A. does not refer to the third cause by name, but it should be clear what sort of cause A.\u0026rsquo;s objections to the \u0026ldquo;purely material\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;purely formal\u0026rdquo; accounts of change point to: the mover (typically\u0026mdash;among perishable things\u0026mdash;the efficient cause).\n","date":1617200160,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618404367,"objectID":"a97048a1305a9510b1a40d50ffce6275","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit3/","publishdate":"2021-03-31T17:16:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit3/","section":"course-hylomorphism","summary":"3.1 | Nature \u0026amp; Causation The unity of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Physics is a matter of scholarly controversy, but it seems clear that Physics 2\u0026ndash;4 (at least) constitute a continuous discussion of nature (phusis).","tags":null,"title":"Unit 3 | Natural Substances as Hylomorphic Compounds","type":"course-hylomorphism"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"4.1 | Is Substance Matter, Form, or What is From Them?

What does this mean?\nAristotle\u0026rsquo;s Division of Sciences (Metaph. E.1)    Theoretical Sciences Sciences that aim at no end beyond understanding itself.  Physics (Natural Philosophy): Studies beings that are movable and inseparable from matter qua movable and inseparable (in thought) from matter. Mathematics: Studies beings that are movable and inseparable from matter qua immovable and separable (in thought) from matter. Theology (First Philosophy): Studies immovable, separable being qua immovable and separable.   Question What makes this identical to the study of being as such?  \u0026ldquo;Being is said in many ways\u0026rdquo;    Aristotle is committed to the existence of a unified science of being\u0026hellip;\n Metaphysics Γ.1 (Ross tr.)\nThere is a science which investigates being as being and the attributes which belong to this in virtue of its own nature. Now this is not the same as any of the so-called special sciences; for none of these others deals generally with being as [25] being. They cut off a part of being and investigate the attributes of this part—this is what the mathematical sciences for instance do. Now since we are seeking the first principles and the highest causes, clearly there must be some thing to which these belong in virtue of its own nature. If then our predecessors who sought the elements of existing things were seeking these same principles, it is necessary that the [30] elements must be elements of being not by accident but just because it is being. Therefore it is of being as being that we also must grasp the first causes.\n      But there is a problem\u0026hellip;\nBeing is said in many ways!\n Metaphysics Z.1, 1028a9\u0026ndash;12 (Ross tr.)\nThere are several senses in which a thing may be said to be, as we pointed [10] out previously in our book on the various senses of words; for in one sense it means what a thing is or a ‘this’, and in another sense it means that a thing is of a certain quality or quantity or has some such predicate asserted of it.\n      Solution?\nBeing has a \u0026ldquo;primary sense\u0026rdquo;, namely substance:\n Metaphysics Z.1, 1028a12\u0026ndash;19 (Ross tr.)\nWhile ‘being’ has all these senses, obviously that which is primarily is the ‘what’, which indicates the substance of the thing. For when we say of what quality a thing is, we say that it is [15] good or beautiful, but not that it is three cubits long or that it is a man; but when we say what it is, we do not say ‘white’ or ‘hot’ or ‘three cubits long’, but ‘man’ or ‘God’. And all other things are said to be because they are, some of them, quantities of that which is in this primary sense, others qualities of it, others affections of it, and others some other determination of it.\n      Background to the Solution\nBeing is spoken of \u0026ldquo;pros hen\u0026rdquo;, i.e. in relation to one, primary referent:\n Metaphysics Γ.2, 1003a33\u0026ndash;b18 (Ross tr.)\nThere are many senses in which a thing may be said to ‘be’, but they are related to one central point, one definite kind of thing, and are not homonymous. [35]\n  Everything which is healthy is related to health, one thing in the sense that it preserves health, another in the sense that it produces it, another in the sense that it is a symptom of health, another because it is capable of it. And that which is [1003b1] medical is relative to the medical art, one thing in the sense that it possesses it, another in the sense that it is naturally adapted to it, another in the sense that it is a function of the medical art. And we shall find other words used similarly to these.\n  [5] So, too, there are many senses in which a thing is said to be, but all refer to one starting-point; some things are said to be because they are substances, others because they are affections of substance, others because they are a process towards substance, or destructions or privations or qualities of substance, or productive or generative of substance, or of things which are relative to substance, or negations of [10] some of these things or of substance itself.\n  [\u0026hellip;]\nAs, then, there is one science which deals with all healthy things, the same applies in the other cases also. [\u0026hellip;] It is clear then that it is the work of one science [15] also to study all things that are, qua being.\nBut everywhere science deals chiefly with that which is primary, and on which the other things depend, and in virtue of which they get their names. If, then, this is substance, it is of substances that the philosopher must grasp the principles and the causes.\n Hence the grand conclusion of Metaphysics Z.1 (1028b3\u0026ndash;5, Ross tr.)\n And indeed the question which, both now and of old, has always been raised, and always been the subject of doubt, viz. what being is, is just the question, what is [5] substance?\n      Aside on First Philosophy as Theology\nQuestion : What is \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; in the primary sense?\nAnswer : Substance, but \u0026ldquo;there are three kinds of substance\u0026rdquo; (Metaphysics Λ.1): - Natural: i.e., movable, of which there are two kinds: - Perishable: Plants, animals, their parts, simple bodies\n - **Eternal:** Celestial substances - **Immovable:** Unchanging, separable from matter.  Immovable substance is the first principle of all (and, according to many commentators, being in the primary sense):\n Metaphysics Λ.6, 1071b3\u0026ndash;21\nSince there were three kinds of substance, two of them natural and one unmovable, regarding the latter we must assert that it is necessary that there should be an eternal unmovable substance. For substances are the first of existing things, [5] and if they are all destructible, all things are destructible. But it is impossible that movement should either come into being or cease to be; for it must always have existed.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThere must, then, be such a principle, whose very substance is [20] actuality. Further, then, these substances must be without matter; for they must be eternal, at least if anything else is eternal. Therefore they must be actuality.\n   The Project of Metaphysics Z To answer the question, \u0026ldquo;what is subsance (ousia)\u0026rdquo;?\n Metaphysics Z.2, 1028b27\u0026ndash;33 (Ross tr.)\nRegarding these matters, then, we must inquire which of the common statements are right and which are not right, and what things are substances, and whether there are or are not any besides sensible substances, and how sensible [30] substances exist, and whether there is a separable substance (and if so why and how) or there is no substance separable from sensible substances; and we must first sketch the nature of substance.\n What is the nature of substance?  Metaphysics Z.3, 1028b34\u0026ndash;1029a6 (Ross tr.)\nThe word ‘substance’ is applied, if not in more senses, still at least to four main objects; for both (1) the essence and (2) the universal and (3) the genus are thought to be [35] the substance of each thing, and fourthly (4) the substratum.\nNow (4) the substratum is that of which other things are predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything else. And so we must first determine the nature of this; for that which underlies a [1029a1] thing primarily is thought to be in the truest sense its substance. And:\n  in one sense (4a) matter is said to be of the nature of substratum,\n  in another, (4b) shape, and\n  in a third sense, (4c) the compound of these.\n  By the matter I mean, for instance, the bronze, by the shape the plan of its form, and by the compound of these (the concrete thing) the [5] statue. Therefore if the form is prior to the matter and more real, it will be prior to the compound also for the same reason.\n  Observation 1 Aristotle moves quickly from the question \u0026ldquo;what is substance\u0026rdquo; to the question \u0026ldquo;what is the substance of each thing\u0026rdquo;? (Cf. the following lines: \u0026ldquo;We have now outlined the nature of substance, showing that it is that which is not predicated of a subject, but of which all else is predicated.\u0026quot;)  Question: Are these questions equivalent?   Observation 2 Aristotle offers four candidates for an answer to the question(s) \u0026ldquo;what is substance?\u0026rdquo; and/or \u0026ldquo;what is the substance of x?\u0026quot;:  The essence of (\u0026ldquo;what-being-is for\u0026rdquo;) x. The universal to which x (qua substance?) belongs. The genus to which x belongs. The substatum of (that which underlies) x. Procedure of Metaphysics Z :: Aristotle will create problems for each of these candidates, only to propose (in Z.17) an entirely different account of substance grounded in the notion that substance is a cause of being.    Substance as Substratum (Z.3)  Question Why cannot the substance of x be identified with that which underlies x? Answer If it were, \u0026ldquo;matter becomes substance\u0026rdquo;:  Metaphysics Z.3, 1029a9\u0026ndash;32 (Ross tr.)\nFor if this is not substance, it is [10] beyond us to say what else is. When all else is taken away evidently nothing but matter remains. For of the other elements some are affections, products, and capacities of bodies, while length, breadth, and depth are quantities and not substances. For a quantity is not a substance; but the substance is rather that to [15] which these belong primarily. But when length and breadth and depth are taken away we see nothing left except that which is bounded by these, whatever it be; so that to those who consider the question thus matter alone must seem to be substance. By matter I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor of a [20] certain quantity nor assigned to any other of the categories by which being is determined.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut this is impossible; for both separability and individuality are thought to belong chiefly to substance. And so form and the compound of form and matter would be thought to be substance, rather than matter. The substance compounded of both, [30] i.e. of matter and shape, may be dismissed; for it is posterior and its nature is obvious. And matter also is in a sense manifest. But we must inquire into the third kind of substance [i.e., form]; for this is the most difficult.\n   Substance as Essence (Z.4\u0026ndash;6)  Questions arising:   Q1: Are there essences only of substances like Socrates, or can there be an essence of red or being in Athens as well?\n  If only of substance: What defines what it is to be red?\n  If not only of substance: Then, absurdy, red would be substance, if substance is essence.\n    Q2: If the essence is the substance of x, and if x is identical with its substance, can x be identical with the essence of x?\n  If yes: Contradictions abound! (The \u0026ldquo;pale man\u0026rdquo; argument\u0026hellip;)\n  If no: What would explain the difference between a thing and its essence?\n      Q1 (Z.4)  Answer to Q1 Essence belongs primarily to substance, but derivatively to items in non-substance categories\u0026hellip;   1030a27\u0026ndash;b13 (Ross tr.)\nNow we must inquire how we should express ourselves on each point, but still more how the facts actually stand. And so now also since it is evident what language we use, essence will belong, just as the ‘what’ does, primarily and in the simple sense to substance, and in a secondary way to the other categories also,—not essence [30] simply, but the essence of a quality or of a quantity. For it must be either homonymously that we say these are, or by making qualifications and abstractions (in the way in which that which is not known may be said to be known),—the truth being that we use the word neither homonymously nor in the same sense, but just as we apply the word ‘medical’ when there is a reference to one and the same thing, not meaning one and the same thing, nor yet speaking homonymously; for a patient and [1030b1] an operation and an instrument are called medical neither homonymously nor in virtue of one thing, but with reference to one thing. But it does not matter in which of the two ways one likes to describe the facts; this is evident, that definition and essence in the primary and simple sense belong to substances. Still they belong to [5] other things as well in a similar way, but not primarily.\n Q1 (Z.6) Answer unclear\u0026hellip;\n   The Pale Man Argument (1031a19\u0026ndash;25)\n The pale man is the same as the essence of the pale man (\u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to Q2) The man is the same as the pale man (assumption) So, the essence of the man is the same as the essence of the pale man.       A thing can\u0026rsquo;t be separate from its essence!\n 1031b28\u0026ndash;1032a4 (Ross tr.)\nThe absurdity of the separation would appear also if one were to assign a name to each of the essences; for there would be another essence besides the original one, e.g. to the essence of horse there will belong a second essence. Yet why should not [30] some things be their essences from the start, since essence is substance? But not only are a thing and its essence one, but the formula of them is also the same, as is [1032a1] clear even from what has been said; for it is not by accident that the essence of one, and the one, are one. Further, if they were different, the process would go on to infinity; for we should have the essence of one, and the one, so that in their case also the same infinite regress would be found. Clearly, then, each primary and self-subsistent thing is one and the same as its essence.\n   4.2 | Solutions: Substance as a Cause of Being Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Fresh Start\u0026rdquo; in Metaphysics Z.17  Metaphysics Z.17, 1041a6\u0026ndash;22 (Ross tr.)\nWe should say what, and what sort of thing, substance is, taking another starting-point; for perhaps from this we shall get a clear view also of that substance which exists apart from sensible substances.\nSince, then, substance is a principle and a cause, let us attack it from this standpoint.\n Observation The ‘why’ is always [10] sought in this form—‘why does one thing attach to another?’ For to inquire why the musical man is a musical man, is either to inquire—as we have said—why the man is musical, or it is something else. Objection Now ‘why a thing is itself’ is doubtless a meaningless inquiry; for the fact or the existence of the thing must already be [15] evident (e.g. that the moon is eclipsed), but the fact that a thing is itself is the single formula and the single cause to all such questions as why the man is man, or the musical musical, unless one were to say that each thing is inseparable from itself; and its being one just meant this. Revision This, however, is common to all things and is a short and easy way with the question. But we can inquire why man is an animal of [20] such and such a nature. Here, then, we are evidently not inquiring why he who is a man is a man. We are inquiring, then, why something is predicable of something\u0026hellip;   Background: Inquiry and Explanation in the Analytics How Is Inquiry Possible? Meno\u0026rsquo;s Paradox Recall Meno\u0026rsquo;s Paradox:\n P1 For any item of knowledge, x, either one knows x or one does not know x. P2 If one knows x, one cannot inquire about x. P3 If one does not know x, one cannot inquire about x. C Therefore, one cannot inquire about x.  Two Solutions to the Paradox  Plato \u0026ldquo;learning\u0026rdquo; (mathēsis) is \u0026ldquo;recollection\u0026rdquo; (anamnēsis) Aristotle all \u0026ldquo;inquiry\u0026rdquo; (zētēsis) is a \u0026ldquo;search for the \u0026ldquo;middle term\u0026rdquo;:   Inquiry begins with prior knowledge of the \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rdquo; (hoti), some universal fact.\n  From there the inquirer seeks to know the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; (dihoti), the explanation of that universal fact.\n  The why is given by the middle term of a demonstration of the fact known.\n    The Structure of a Demonstration  \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; Question Why are all S\u0026rsquo;s P? Demonstrative Explanation Because M!     Major Premise All M are P     Minor Premise All S are M   Conclusion So, all S are P    An Example  The \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rdquo; The moon is eclipsed. \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; Question Why is the moon eclipsed? Demonstrative Explanation Because the earth is interposed between it and the sun!     Major Premise Everything the earth is interposed between is eclipsed     Minor Premise The earth is interposed between the moon   Conclusion So, the moon is eclipsed    The Indemonstrability of Principles   For some demonstrations it will be possible to ask \u0026ldquo;why?\u0026rdquo; even about the premises, e.g.:\n  \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; Question: Why do broad-leafed plants shed their leaves?\n  Explanation: M = their sap coagulates at the stem of the leaf\n    However, on pain of an infinite regress, there must be demonstrative premises about which one cannot coherently ask \u0026ldquo;why?\u0026rdquo; (APo 1.3). these \u0026ldquo;first principles\u0026rdquo; will therefore be \u0026ldquo;immediate\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;unmiddled\u0026rdquo;; there is no middle term explaining the connection between subject and predicate.\n  Three kinds of first principle:\n  Axioms: For all p, p or not-p.\n  Posits: A triangle is a three-sided closed plane figure.\n  Definitions: A human being is a rational animal.\n    Metaphysics Z.17\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Fresh Start\u0026rdquo; Revisited  Proposal Substance can be understood as the cause of being. Objection Causal explanations are explanations of why some predicate belongs to some subject per se and in virtue of its essence, but to say that (e.g.) a human being is a rational animal is not a predication but a definition! Revision Definitions can be understood as a kind of predication and as a subject of scientific inquiry:  Metaphysics Z.17, 1041a22\u0026ndash;b32 (Ross tr.)\n\u0026hellip; that it is predicable must be clear; for if not, the inquiry is an inquiry into nothing. [25]\n E.g. why does it thunder?—why is sound produced in the clouds?  Thus the inquiry is about the predication of one thing of another.\n And why are certain things, i.e. stones and bricks, a house?  Plainly we are seeking the cause. And this is the essence (to speak abstractly), which in some cases is that for the sake of which, e.g. perhaps [30] in the case of a house or a bed, and in some cases is the first mover; for this also is a cause. But while the efficient cause is sought in the case of genesis and destruction, the final cause is sought in the case of being also.\n   Example: Substance as the Cause of Being of a House  The \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rdquo; This configuration of stones and bricks is a house. \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; Question Why is this configuration of stones and bricks a house? Demonstrative Explanation Because they are a shelter for persons and their possessions (= SHELTER)!     Major Premise Every SHELTER is a house     Minor Premise This configuration of stones and bricks is a SHELTER   Conclusion So, this configuration of stones and bricks is a house.     Metaphysics Z.17, 1041b6\u0026ndash;8\n\u0026hellip;Clearly the question is why the matter is some individual thing, e.g. why are these materials a house? Because that which was the essence of a house is present. And why is this individual thing, or this body in this state, a man? Therefore what we seek is the cause, i.e. the form, by reason of which the matter is some definite thing; and this is the substance of the thing.\n Two Causes of Being  \u0026ldquo;That for the sake of which\u0026rdquo; E.g., why is this configuration of wood a bed? Because it is a platform for lying on, and this (say) is what it is to be a bed. Why is this configuration of flesh and bones (or an animal of such and such a sort) a human being? Because it is a rational animal, and this is just what a human being is. \u0026ldquo;The first mover\u0026rdquo; E.g. why is this configuration of flesh and bones (or an animal of such and such a sort) going to be a human being? Because it is the production of a rational animal, and this is just what a human being is.  Questions Arising   How does Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s extension of the Analytics model to explanations of the being (as opposed to per se attributes) of substances account for the \u0026ldquo;indemonstrability\u0026rdquo; of definitions?\nRelevant text from Posterior Analytics 2.10 (93b36\u0026ndash;94a12):\n   Thus one definition of definition is the one stated; another definition is an account which makes clear why a thing is. Hence the former type of definition signifies but does not prove, whereas the latter evidently will be a sort of [94a1] demonstration of what a thing is, differing in position from the demonstration.\nFor there is a difference between saying why it thunders and what thunder is; for in the one case you will say: Because the fire is extinguished in the clouds. What is thunder?—A noise of fire being extinguished in the clouds. Hence the same account [5] is put in a different way, and in this way it is a continuous demonstration, in this way a definition.\nAgain, a definition of thunder is noise in the clouds; and this is a conclusion of the demonstration of what it is.\nThe definition of immediates is an undemonstrable positing of what they are. [10] One definition, therefore, is an undemonstrable account of what a thing is; one is a deduction of what it is, differing in aspect from the demonstration; a third is a conclusion of the demonstration of what it is.\n  What about simple essences?   Metaphysics Z.17, 1041b9\u0026ndash;10 (Ross tr.)\nEvidently, then, in the case of simple things no inquiry nor teaching is possible; but we must [10] inquire into them in a different way.\n Of what sorts of substances are the essences simple?\n","date":1619512320,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619594162,"objectID":"b2352d872b66bffe2347293dc71df924","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit4/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T11:32:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/course-hylomorphism/lectures/unit4/","section":"course-hylomorphism","summary":"4.1 | Is Substance Matter, Form, or What is From Them?

Question How does this this conception of substance as both form and cause of being influence Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s approach to natural science, in particular, his zoology or science of animal life?  Big Picture: Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Zoological Works    Work Contents     Historia Animalium Organized presentation of facts (\u0026ldquo;thats\u0026rdquo;) about animal kinds   De Anima Account of \u0026ldquo;nature and essence\u0026rdquo; of soul.

DA 1.1, 402a1\u0026ndash;8 (Shields tr.)\nWe count cognition among the fine and honourable things, and suppose that one kind of cognition is finer and more honourable than another owing to its precision or because of its having better and more marvellous objects; and for both these reasons we may reasonably place an inquiry into the soul into the premier class of study. It also seems that research into the soul contributes greatly to truth in general, and most especially to truth about nature. For the soul is a sort of first principle of animals. We aim to consider and ascertain its nature and essence, and then its properties, of which some seem to be affections peculiar to the soul itself, while others belong to animals as well because of the soul.\n  Method By studying both the form and matter of living things, as a natural scientist would!   DA 1.1, 402b16\u0026ndash;29 (Shields tr.)\nAnd it would seem that all the affections of the soul involve the body\u0026mdash;anger, gentleness, fear, pity, courage, as well as joy, and loving and hating. For at the same time as these, the body is affected in some way. This is shown by the fact that sometimes, even though strong and evident affections are present, we are not provoked or made afraid, while at other times we are moved by something small and obscure, whenever the body is agitated and in the condition it is in when angry. This is even clearer from the fact that sometimes though nothing frightful is present, people come to have the affections of a frightened person.\nIf this is so, it is clear that the affections are accounts in matter. Consequently, definitions will be of this sort, for example: \u0026lsquo;being angry is (1) a sort of motion (2) of a body of such a sort, or of a part or capacity of a body, (3) brought about by this (4) for the sake of that.\u0026rsquo; And for these reasons, a consideration of the soul, either all souls or this sort of soul, is already in the province of the natural scientist.\n Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Definition of Soul in De Anima 2 Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s postive account of soul begins in Book 2 of De Anima, which begins somewhat predictably but marks a radical change in the focus of psychological investigation. In summary:\n De Anima 2.1 Soul is the form and first actuality of an organic body, a body having the potential for life. De Anima 2.2 This can serve only as an \u0026ldquo;outline\u0026rdquo; account of soul, since \u0026ldquo;living is said in many ways\u0026rdquo;. De Anima 2.3 To formulate a \u0026ldquo;scientific\u0026rdquo; definition of soul\u0026mdash;one that explains how soul operates as the cause of life\u0026mdash;we must turn our attention to the principal capacities of soul, including nutrition, reproduction, perception, locomotion, and thought.  The Outline Account of Soul in De Anima 2.1  DA 2.1, 412a 5\u0026ndash;22 (Shields tr.)\nWe say that among the things that exist one kind is substance, and that one sort is substance as matter, which is not in its own right some this; another is shape and form, in accordance with which it is already called some this; and the third is what comes from these. Matter is potentiality, while form is actuality; and actuality is spoken of in two ways, first as knowledge is, and second as contemplating is.\nBodies seem most of all to be substances, and among these, natural bodies, since these are the principles of the others. Among natural bodies, some have life and some do not have it. By \u0026lsquo;life\u0026rsquo; we mean that which has through itself nourishment, growth, and decay.\nIt would follow that every natural body having life is a substance, and a substance as a compound. But since it is also a body of this sort-for it has life-the soul could not be a body; for the body is not among those things said of a subject, but rather is spoken of as a subject and as matter. It is necessary, then, that the soul is a substance as the form of a natural body which has life in potentiality. But substance is actuality; hence, the soul will be an actuality of a body of such a sort.\n Two refinements:\n Soul is the actuality in the way knowledge is (= first actuality) rather than the way contemplating is (= second actuality):   DA 2.1, 412a23\u0026ndash;29 (Shields tr.)\nActuality is spoken of in two ways, first as knowledge is, and second as contemplating is. Evidently, then, the soul is actuality as knowledge is. For both sleeping and waking depend upon the soul\u0026rsquo;s being present; and as waking is analogous to contemplating, sleeping is analogous to having knowledge without exercising it. And in the same individual knowledge is prior in generation. Hence, the soul is the first actuality of a natural body which has life in potentiality.\n  A body having the potential for life is an organic (functionally organized) body:   DA 2.1, 412b1\u0026ndash;6 (Shields tr.)\nThis sort of body would be one which is organic. And even the parts of plants are organs, although altogether simple ones. For example, the leaf is a shelter of the outer covering, and the outer covering of the fruit; and the roots are analogous to the mouth, since both draw in nourishment. Hence, if it is necessary to say something which is common to every soul, it would be that the soul is the first actuality of an organic natural body.\n    A Complication: the \u0026ldquo;Ackrill Problem\u0026rdquo;\n  To be the material cause of a process of generation, the body must be capable of receiving contrary forms.\n  According to DA 2.1, however, the body seems to be necessarily enformed with soul; a dead body, or a body (or body part) lacking soul is a body only homonymously:\n DA 2.1, 412b25\u0026ndash;27 (Shields tr.)\nThe body which has cast off its soul is not a being which is potentially such as to be alive; this is rather the one that has soul. The seed, however, and the fruit, is such a body (= a body potentially such as to be alive?) in potentiality.\n   How, then, can the body be the matter for soul?\n    The Homonymy of Life in De Anima 2.2 The account of soul offered in DA 2.1 is however only an \u0026ldquo;outline\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;general\u0026rdquo; account of soul, not a scientific definition specifying its essence. Why?\n De Anima 2.2, 413a11\u0026ndash;20 (Shields tr.)\nBecause what is sure and better known as conforming to reason comes to be from what is unsure but more apparent, one must try to proceed anew in this way concerning the soul. For it is not only necessary that a defining account make clear the that, which is what most definitions state, but it must also contain and make manifest the cause. As things are, statements of definitions are like conclusions. For example: \u0026lsquo;what is squaring? It is an equilateral rectangle being equal to an oblong figure.\u0026rsquo; But this sort of definition is an account of the conclusion: the one who states that squaring is the discovery of a mean states the cause of the matter.\n To see what Aristotle has in mind here, we need to appreciate a difficulty for the science of soul that Aristotle raised back in DA 1.1:\n DA 1.1, 402b5\u0026ndash;8 (Shields tr.)\nAnd one must take care not to overlook the question of whether\n there is one account of soul, as there is one account of animal,  or whether\n there is a different account for each type of soul, for example, of horse, of dog, of man, of god, while the universal animal is either nothing or is posterior to these;  and it would be the same if any other common thing were being predicated.\n In DA 2.2, Aristotle offers reason for thinking that \u0026ldquo;there is a different account of each type of soul\u0026rdquo;, namely that living is said in many ways:\n DA 2.2, 413a21\u0026ndash;25 (Shields tr.)\nWe say, then, taking up the beginning of the inquiry, that what is ensouled is distinguished from what is not ensouled by living. But living is spoken of in several ways. And should even one of these belong to something, we say that it is alive: reason, perception, motion and rest with respect to place, and further the motion in relation to nourishment, decay, and growth.\n Specifically:\n Nutrition (Growth, Decay, Reproduction) Belongs to everything that is said to live, including plants and animals. Perception Belongs to animals but not to plants. Locomotion Belongs to some animals. Reason Belongs to apparently one kind of animal: humans.  On the assumption that soul is the cause of life in living things: how can there be a single account of soul, given how many different ways living is spoken of?\nThe Unity of Psychology: De Anima 2.3 Aristotle showed in DA 2.2 that no univocal definition (of the sort given in DA 2.1) of soul could capture its role as the cause of life in the many ways in which living things are said to live. Instead, we need to study the soul of each kind of living thing individually:\n DA 2.3, 414b25\u0026ndash;28 (Shields tr.)\nFor this reason, it is ludicrous to seek a common account in these cases, or in other cases, an account which is not peculiar to anything which exists, and which does not correspond to any proper and indivisible species, while neglecting what is of this sort. Consequently, one must ask individually what the soul of each is, for example, what the soul of a plant is, and what the soul of a man or a beast is.\n This does not mean, however, that there is not unified science of psychology, as opposed to a set of unrelated sciences of botany, zoology, and anthropology. To the contrary, there is a systematic relation among the capacities of soul present in plants, animals, and humans:\n DA 2.3, 414b29\u0026ndash;415a13 (Shields tr.)\nWhat holds in the case of the soul is very close to what holds concerning figures: for in the case of both figures and ensouled things, what is prior is always present potentially in what follows in a series\u0026mdash;for example, the triangle in the square, and the nutritive faculty in the perceptual faculty. One must investigate the reason why they are thus in a series.\n  For the percepual faculty is not without the nutritive, though the nutritive faculty is separated from the perceptual in plants.\n  Again, without touch, none of the other senses are present, though touch is present without the others; for many animals have neither sight nor hearing nor a sense of smell.\n  Also, among things capable of perceiving, some have motion in respect of place, while others do not.\n  Lastly, and most rarely, some have reasoning and understanding.

I argue that the explanatory role of the soul in Aristotle’s natural science must be understood in light of his view, stated in a controversial passage from _Parts of Animals_ (645b14–20), that the soul of a living thing is a “complex activity” of its organic body. This paper explores the role of this “complex activity” model of soul in Aristotle’s study of soul in _De Anima_. I argue, first, that the model has its origins in _De Anima_ II.4, where Aristotle argues that living things do all they do by nature for the sake of a single, teleologically primary end. I argue further that Aristotle uses this model to account for the psychological attributes naturally present in living things, including their capacities for vital activities like nutrition, reproduction, and perception, and that this is the task to which Aristotle devotes the obscure final chapters of _De Anima_ III.","tags":null,"title":"Why De Anima Needs III 12-13","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598013775,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612517334,"objectID":"4a4720f7644ed3fde75ed4f65155fe9b","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/illusion/","publishdate":"2020-08-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/illusion/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"Illusion: When Appearances Deceive","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612517334,"objectID":"461c688f0c0f86a4d5ceee9646b9abe3","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/hylomorphism/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/hylomorphism/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Current Courses"],"title":"Aristotle's Hylomorphism","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601042670,"objectID":"00b42fa4af85f4135364d57e8202883b","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/aristotles-soul/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/aristotles-soul/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"Aristotle's Soul","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601042670,"objectID":"732511d730794cae55e9ca45c42dabeb","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/color/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/color/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"Color and Color Experience","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612517334,"objectID":"fb76538064abf55c21a0dfd38f61c003","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/modern/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/modern/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Current Courses"],"title":"Early Modern Philosophy","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601042670,"objectID":"ee7846cf297889fe92e070e76c3b369e","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/criterion/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/criterion/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"The Problem of the Criterion","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How to Write a Philosophy Paper  The Goal of a Philosophy Paper  Question What makes a philosophy paper successful?\n \rAnswer\rA successful philosophy paper does two things:\n\r\r1. It makes an argument for a specific claim; i.e., it defends a thesis!\r\r\r2. The argument it makes is intelligible and convincing to the reader as well.\r\r Planning a Successful Philosophy Paper  \r Step 1: Select a thesis \r\r\r Exercise: What theses address the TP1 prompt? \r What is the objection Elisabeth is raising for Cartesian dualism, and how does Descartes respond to it? Is Elisabeth’s objection successful? Why, or why not?\n \r \rStep 2: Develop an argument for that thesis.\r\r\rThree forms of argument\r 1. Deductive [Must be Valid and Sound!] \rAll humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Moose is a dog. Moose does not have fleas. Therefore, not all dogs have fleas.\n\r\rThree forms of argument\r 2. Inductive [Sample Must be Representative!]\ra, b, c, and d are all Fs which are also G. Therefore, all Fs are Gs.\n\r\rThree forms of argument\r3. Abductive [Must be Best Available Explanation!]\rIncrease in carbon emissions correlates with increasingly rapid climate change; there is no other correlation which could better explain increasingly rapid climate change; therefore, increase in carbon emissions causes climate change.\n\r\rExercise: What argument(s) support the theses that address the TP1 prompt?\r(Hint: by identifying the form of argument Descartes is giving, we can develop a strategy for supporting or undermining it.)\n\r \rStep 3: Construct an outline\r\r\r(Hint: your outline should present the argument in a way that your peers can understand.)\r\r\rElements of an outline\rI. Introduction\rIntroduces the problem/question; draws in the reader; states thesis.\n\r\rElements of an outline\rII. Exegesis [Optional]\rAdds any other relevant information that the reader must know in order to understand the argument to come.\n\r\rElements of an outline\rIII. Body\rStates, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the argument for the thesis.\n\r\rElements of an outline\rIV. Conclusion\rProvides extremely brief restatement of thesis and argument for it; convinces the reader of the significance of the paper\u0026rsquo;s conclusion(s)\n\r\rExercise: Construct an outline for the TP1 thesis you've chosen.\r(Hints: If you\u0026rsquo;re arguing that Descartes' response is successful, why is the most convincing argument against his conclusion incorrect? If you\u0026rsquo;re arguing that his argument is unsuccessful, where does the argument go wrong?)\n\r \rStep 4: Fill in your outline with complete sentences\r\r\r(Hint: Ideally, the most nested items in each \u0026ldquo;branch\u0026rdquo; of your outline will correspond to a single paragraph.)\n\r Developing Philosophical Writing Skills  Tips for Writing Philosophy  Get to the point!

Argument reconstructions \rTake an argumentative passage, identify the premises and conclusion, and restate the argument in your own words.\n\r\rSample Passage 1: The Cartesian Circle (AT 214)\rMy only remaining concern is whether the author does not commit a vicious circle when he says that we have no other basis on which to establish that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true, than that God exists. But we can be certain that God exists only because we clearly and evidently perceive this fact. Therefore, before we are certain that God exists, we ought to be certain that whatever we clearly and evidently perceive is true.\n\r\rSample Passage 2: Malebranche on the one true cause\rThe motive force of bodies is therefore not in the bodies that are moved, for this motive force is nothing other than the will of God. Thus bodies have no action; and when a moving ball collides with and moves another, it communicates to it nothing of its own, for it does not itself have the force it communicates. However, a ball is the natural cause of the motion it communicates. A natural cause is therefore not a real and true but only an occasional cause, one that determines the Author of nature to act in such and such a manner in such and such a situation.

The book, Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination, will be the first dedicated study of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s thesis that the senses are discriminative capacities of soul. While this thesis has received greater attention from commentators in recent years, it has for the most part been considered in isolation from its context in the explanatory project of the Aristotelian life sciences, and read instead as part of an attempt to explain the character of ordinary perceptual experience. I argue that this has been a mistake. For Aristotle, the significance of the thesis that the senses are discriminative capacities concerns precisely the teleological role of sense perception in animal life. To the question, why do animals perceive in the ways they do?, Aristotle has a single, univocal answer: because the senses are discriminative capacities. By this, Aristotle means that the senses belong to the animals that have them because discriminating by means of those senses promotes the achievement of the ends those animals naturally pursue. Understanding Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s thesis that the senses discriminate therefore requires understanding how Aristotle thinks sensory discrimination contributes to goals that structure animal life.\nThe book defends a novel answer to this question. For Aristotle, discriminating a sensible quality by means of the sense that perceives it is a way of knowing that quality\u0026mdash;a state Aristotle understands as one in which the perceiver is presented with the cause of a perceptual experience as that cause essentially is. For this reason, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s argument for the thesis that the senses are discriminative capacities is a case for regarding perception as a kind of knowledge.\nI present Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s case as a response to two historical challenges, Democritean Eliminativism and Platonic Intellectualism. According to Democritean Eliminativism, sensible qualities such as colors and flavors cannot be objects of knowledge because they are not genuine causes but rather effects on a perceiver\u0026mdash;a view that in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s estimation amounts to the denial that sensible qualities exist at all. According to Platonic Intellectualism, even if the senses put the perceiver in touch with genuine causes, perception of sensible qualities cannot amount to knowledge of these qualities, since only the soul by itself can \u0026ldquo;discriminate\u0026rdquo; the being of the qualities perceived by the senses.\nPart 1: Against Democritean Eliminativism Against Democritean Eliminativism, Aristotle defends a thoroughly realist and objectivist conception of sensible qualities. On his view, colors, flavors, and other sensible qualities are identical to the perceiver-independent causal features of sensible bodies that enable them to produce experiences of those qualities in us. Chapter 1 argues that this conception of sensible qualities should be distinguished from Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s discussion in De Anima of sensible objects, which are perceiver-dependent in a way sensible qualities are not. Chapter 2 defends an interpretation of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of the essence of sensible qualities in De Sensu. I argue that Aristotle defends a physicalist conception of sensible qualities. But unlike modern physicalists, Aristotle denies that there is a necessary contrast between the way a perceptual quality appears in experience and the way it essentially is. Since a perceptual quality is “mixture and motion,” it can appear in experience as the perceiver-independent property it essentially is.\nPart 2: Against Platonic Intellectualism Chapters 3\u0026ndash;5 detail Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s response to Platonic Intellectualism. As Aristotle sees it, the challenge is to show that the senses themselves can discriminate the sensible qualities they perceive. I argue that Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of the sensory capacities of the soul are designed in part to meet this challenge. Chapter 3 considers Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view that the senses are like \u0026ldquo;ratios\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;mean states\u0026rdquo; of the qualities they perceive, a claim that forms the basis of an argument demonstrating that the senses discriminate. On the interpretation I provide, the senses are mean states because each is the form and final cause of an organ that, qua organ of that sense, instantiates the objective mean of the scale of qualities that sense perceives. This interpretation sets up a question about the nature of perceptual affection\u0026mdash;one that has received abundant attention from scholars in recent decades. Chapter 4 addresses this question with a novel proposal. Perceptual affection is neither a literal alteration of the sense organ nor a purely formal or \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; change. It is not a change at all, but an affection whose nature is exhausted by the activity of a sensible quality and excludes any alteration of the organ\u0026mdash;a process Aristotle in another context compares to getting a sunburn or growing red from embarrassment.\nDrawing on this conception of the sensory mean state, Chapter 5 presents Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s argument demonstrating that the senses discriminate. The demonstration is initially obscure, but Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s reasoning is illuminated by an analogy with his celebrated doctrine of the ethical mean. Because virtue is a mean state, vicious actions and emotions appear to the virtuous person as what they essentially are, namely excessive or deficient. Similarly, because each sense is a mean state, the qualities it perceives appear to it as what they essentially are, namely light or dark, sweet or bitter, or more generally as occupying the objective position on the quality scale that defines each as the quality it is. For a sense to “discriminate” a perceptual quality, then, is for that quality to appear to the sensory mean state as what it essentially is.\nPart 3: The Significance of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Perceptual Epistemology The final part of the book explores the psychological, epistemological, and historical consequences of this conception of perceptual discrimination. Chapter 6 considers the unity of the senses in numerically one and the same perceptual capacity and the consequent ability of perceivers both to make discriminations across sensory modalities and to perceive the unity of sensible qualities in a single sensible body. While Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s much-discussed attempts to account for these advanced forms of perceptual discrimination may fail, I argue that they provide indirect support for the present interpretation of sensory discrimination. For the theoretical limitations that seem to prevent Aristotle from providing a satisfactory account of these forms of perceptual discrimination stem from a conception of the senses that, I argue, Aristotle takes to be central to his demonstrative account of sensory discrimination.\nChapter 7 considers Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s claim that perception is a gnôsis tis, a mode of \u0026ldquo;cognition\u0026rdquo; or knowledge. While this claim has led many commentators to conclude that Aristotle has an \u0026ldquo;implicitly graded\u0026rdquo; notion of cognition, on the present interpretation perception turns out to be a full-fledged cognitive capacity, standing in relation to sensible qualities as scientific knowledge, craft knowledge, and nous do to their respective objects. In support of this reading, I consider Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s teleological explanations of sense perception in non-rational animals in De Anima and De Sensu, drawing on Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s conception of soul as a \u0026ldquo;complex activity\u0026rdquo; organized in the pursuit of a single, teleologically primary end. I also consider the role of perception in scientific inquiry in the Posterior Analytics, arguing that the \u0026ldquo;prior knowledge\u0026rdquo; provided by perception from which rational perceivers come to know the first principles of a science consists in knowledge of the causes of particular sensory experiences.\nFinally, Chapter 8 provides a historical epilogue to the foregoing discussion of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s theory of perceptual discrimination. I argue that, in responding to Democritean Eliminativism and Platonic Intellectualism, Aristotle sees himself as reviving a Protagorean conception of perception as a measure or \u0026ldquo;criterion\u0026rdquo; for objects' possession of sensible qualities, although one which respects a thoroughly realist and objectivist ontology. Understanding Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s perceptual epistemology in this way, I argue, brings it into close contact with next-generation debates over whether the senses or our sensory impressions can serve as \u0026ldquo;criteria of truth,\u0026rdquo; a result that promises to shed new light on the development of Hellenistic epistemology.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"89ff084a5be25d214368c0582ab90932","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/research/book/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/research/book/","section":"research","summary":"Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination After \u0026ldquo;Aristotle on Why the Senses Discriminate\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Aristotle on the End of an Organism\u0026rsquo;s Nature\u0026rdquo; are accepted for publication, I plan to write a book manuscript that draws together both major topics of my research.","tags":null,"title":"Book Project","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Teaching at the University of Toronto (located in the heart of a richly multicultural city), the University of Pittsburgh (with its large and international student body), and Koç University (where almost none of the students share my linguistic or cultural upbringing) has given me experience with students from a wide variety of cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds and of different philosophical abilities. In my view, engaging with such a diversity of perspectives is one of the pleasures of teaching philosophy. But I also believe that a diverse student body places special responsibilities on a teacher of philosophy, who must be sensitive to the different needs of students as they approach philosophical texts, aware of the cultural presuppositions of major philosophical figures that may not be shared by all students, and willing to confront the perception that philosophy is a devotion exclusive to affluent white men.\nI am committed to facilitating fruitful engagement with philosophical texts for students of all cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds, and in my teaching I take measures to promote every student\u0026rsquo;s interest and success in her philosophical education. First, I make an effort to maximize the diversity of my syllabi in courses on the history of philosophy as well as on contemporary topics. While this may seem harder to do in the history of philosophy, I have found success incorporating women philosophers and philosophers of color in developing and teaching syllabi for ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. In the medieval and modern periods we are fortunate to have correspondence of some of those periods' major figures\u0026mdash;including Abelard, Descartes, Leibniz, and Locke\u0026mdash;with lesser-known women philosophers, including Héloïse, Elizabeth of Bohemia, and Margaret Cavendish. I think these correspondence are valuable teaching tools and I make them a central feature of my introductory course on modern philosophy. The ancient period is more difficult, in particular since almost nothing survives from women intellectuals of that period. However, in my teaching I try to stress the significance of medieval Arabic and North African philosophers (who are also worthy of study in their own right) on the transmission and interpretation of ancient philosophers, especially Aristotle, as well the important role that women philosophers and philosophers of color have played in advancing current our understanding of ancient philosophical texts.\nI believe diversifying syllabi benefits students in at least two ways. First, it demonstrates the variety of perspectives that have shaped and continue to shape the discipline. Second, it exposes students to philosophical themes in ways that may be more compelling and relevant to their experience. For instance, the unit on metaphysics in my introduction to philosophy course frames issues concerning essence and human nature in terms of contemporary debates about the relationship between our biological nature as human beings and other aspects of our respective identities, including race and disability. By presenting fundamental metaphysical questions through the work of minority philosophers like Charles Mills and Elizabeth Barnes, I aim to show students that even abstract philosophical questions can bear on issues relevant to their own lives.\nA second measure I take, especially when teaching the history of philosophy, is to ensure that all students are provided with the historical and cultural context necessary for understanding course material. The importance of this practice was impressed on me several years ago, when, as a TA for a course on early medieval philosophy, an international student asked me to explain what is distinctive about the Christian God. What surprised me about the question was that I had assumed\u0026mdash;wrongly\u0026mdash;that my students shared the same broad familiarity with the religious context of medieval Christian philosophers that I received from my own upbringing. From then on, I have striven to reflect critically on the assumptions I bring to my presentation of especially classical philosophical texts, and as far as possible to make those assumptions explicit for the benefit of those who do not share my cultural background.\nFinally, I take measures in student evaluation to counteract my own implicit biases and to encourage the success of students who, for various reasons, struggle with English academic prose. In general, I rely on anonymous grading as much as possible, and I encourage students who would benefit from alternative forms of evaluation to work with me to develop a suitable approach to their assessment, whether it involves verbal testing by one-on-one discussion with me, take home reports, or other means. However, one form of evaluation I\u0026rsquo;ve insisted on is writing. In many cases, I think it is a disservice to students not to use a philosophy course as a vehicle for improving skills as important as prose composition. Nevertheless, I also recognize that some students have greater educational deficits to overcome in their writing than others. I have various ways of helping these students improve their writing and succeed in my courses, including encouraging them to seek help from me in drafting papers, taking time to correct grammar in grading drafts, and (when necessary) exercising lenience in penalizing poor grammar to encourage students to express their philosophical ideas to the best of their ability.\nThere is more I can do to encourage the interest and success in philosophy of a diverse student body, and I am interested in learning and testing new methods for doing so. I see philosophy as a \u0026ldquo;big tent\u0026rdquo; discipline, one that can and ought to welcome a diversity of perspectives. As a white, cisgender male, I believe my role in advancing this conception of the discipline is to give a platform for voices different from my own to make their contribution.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"2a78cd5670ce8078c86c9cd566fbbed7","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/dossier/diversity/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/dossier/diversity/","section":"dossier","summary":"Teaching at the University of Toronto (located in the heart of a richly multicultural city), the University of Pittsburgh (with its large and international student body), and Koç University (where almost none of the students share my linguistic or cultural upbringing) has given me experience with students from a wide variety of cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds and of different philosophical abilities.","tags":null,"title":"Diversity Statement","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  A caption   --\rThis section provides evidence for my effectiveness in teaching drawn from student evaluations.

On a straightforward reading, his argument is conspicuously bad, failing specifically to rule out a rival innatist position that would have appeared viable both in his view and in that of his likely opponents. My aim in this paper is to show that Aristotle can be credited with a more satisfactory and, by his lights, cogent argument if we read it as an appeal to a distinctively natural scientific form of explanation, what Aristotle sometimes calls \u0026ldquo;hypothetical necessity.\u0026rdquo; In doing so, however, I argue that we must also come to see that Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s conception of the role of perception in coming to know first principles is rooted in substantive and controversial psychological theses that find support, not in the foregoing chapters of the Posterior Analytics, but in natural scientific works like De Anima and the Parva Naturalia.\n Status: Revise \u0026amp; Resubmit  Revelation and Reduction in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Science of Sensible Qualities Aristotle shares with modern physicalists the view that colors and other sensible qualities are identical to the properties that cause us to experience them. Unlike modern physicalists, however, Aristotle does not conclude from this that ordinary sense experience therefore cannot \u0026ldquo;reveal\u0026rdquo; to us what sensible qualities essentially are. In this paper, I propose to explain why. The reason, I contend, is not just that Aristotle’s physics is radically different from our own. To be sure, Aristotle does not see the same structural disanalogies between the world as we experience it and as it is described by fundamental physics, but for him too the identification of sensible qualities with the causes of sense experience is reductive, an attempt to explain sensible qualities in terms of more general\u0026mdash;and scientifically sophisticated\u0026mdash;causal connections. Nevertheless, for Aristotle the value of sense perception consists in its ability to make perceivers aware of the physical properties responsible for those experiences. In defending this view, I argue, Aristotle articulates a conception of perceptual knowledge that is both interesting in its own right and provides a novel justification for the intuitive thesis that experience of sensible qualities reveals, in some way or other, what those qualities essentially are.\n Status: Accepted by Editor, Revisions Pending; Draft Available Upon Request  Aristotle on Why the Senses Discriminate Aristotle regards the senses as \u0026ldquo;discriminative\u0026rdquo; (kritikê), capacities not only to be affected by and perceive sensible qualities, but also to \u0026ldquo;discriminate and cognize something that is.\u0026rdquo; Commentators since antiquity have tended to make two assumptions about the sensory capacity to discriminate: first that it is a capacity the senses have essentially, and second that its exercise results in a certain sort of experience, e.g. as of the difference between sensible qualities or their unity in a sensible body. I argue that both assumptions are mistaken. First, I argue that the capacity to discriminate is not essential but a scientifically knowable attribute of the senses, and that in De Anima Aristotle offers two arguments explaining why the senses discriminate, one final causal and one formal causal. Second, I argue that the capacity these arguments attribute to the senses is epistemically far richer than commentators have supposed: the capacity to become aware of the mind-independent features of sensible bodies.\n Status: In Progress  On Soul as a \u0026ldquo;Complex Activity\u0026rdquo; in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Natural Science Aristotle on the End of an Organism\u0026rsquo;s Nature In at least four passages of the corpus, Aristotle appeals to what we might term the \u0026ldquo;natural end\u0026rdquo; of an organism. The notion is evidently significant for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s approach to the life sciences, appearing decisively in explanations of phenomena such as animal perception and the observable order of embryonic development. However, both the notion and its explanatory role have been neglected in recent studies of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s natural teleology. This paper develops an interpretation of the natural end of an organism and its explanatory role in the Aristotelian life sciences, in an effort to prepare the way for a full appreciation of this important feature of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s natural teleology.\nOn the interpretation I defend, the natural end of an organism is the realization of the natural activity for whose sake that organism possesses and engages in each of the activities it is naturally capable of engaging in. So understood, the notion of an organism\u0026rsquo;s natural end is bound intimately to a conception of organic life, and hence of the soul, as a complex of activities unified in the pursuit of a single, teleologically primary activity. This \u0026ldquo;complex activity model\u0026rdquo; of soul originates in De Anima, but its explanatory implications reach to Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of organic development and morphology, accounting in particular for the developmental priority the parts of the animal body through the use of which the animal achieves the \u0026ldquo;goal that is the function of its nature.\u0026rdquo;\n Status: In Progress  Material Nature in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Parts of Animals Biological kinds are thought to pose a special problem for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s approach to explanation. The problem is that some physiological attributes naturally belonging to living things seem not to be explained by their soul\u0026mdash;their form and essence\u0026mdash;but by their matter. I argue that the problem is only apparent, and that we can see the soul as the basis of even these explanations if we take into account Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s claim in Parts of Animals 1.5 (645b28\u0026ndash;646a2) that the organic parts of a living body stand in teleological relations that mirror those of the psychic activities for which they are instruments. On the basis of this claim, I argue that the soul accounts for a living thing\u0026rsquo;s physiological attributes as both an efficient cause of its coming to be and the final cause of its being. I support this interpretation by showing that the parallel relations of teleological priority among psychic capacities and their material organs explain, first of all, the order in which the parts of the animal body are said to develop in Generation of Animals, and second, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s appeal to \u0026ldquo;material nature\u0026rdquo; in some controversial passages of Parts of Animals.\n Status: Projected  On Other Topics in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Psychology Hearing Speech Incidentally: An Aristotelian Distinction Concerning Perceptual Content There is a familiar difference between the experience of hearing a language one understands and the experience of hearing a language one doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand. But theorists disagree on how this contrast is reflected in the content of these auditory experiences. Conservative approaches take the difference to concern non-semantic properties of the linguistic utterance, including low-level properties (such as pitch and timbre) as well as language-specific properties (such as being this or that phoneme). Liberal approaches, by contrast, take the difference also to concern whether the subject hears, or fails to hear, the meaning of the relevant utterance. I argue for a moderate approach, taking my point of departure from the Aristotelian idea that the meaning of a linguistic utterance is audible, but only \u0026ldquo;incidentally\u0026rdquo; so. I argue that this approach avoids the difficulties facing both the conservative and liberal approaches, and moreover provides a model for a broadly speaking Aristotelian theory of perceptual content that warrants serious consideration in its own right.\n Status: Preliminary Draft  Aristotle on Why Animals Have Phantasia Aristotle gives contradictory answers to the question whether all animals have phantasia (imagination). But while some commentators have claimed that Aristotle ultimately defends a positive or negative answer to the question, I argue that his ambivalence is well-motivated. Aristotle is pulled in different directions because he attributes two distinct roles to phantasia. In all animals it is responsible for the phenomenal character of experience, but it also serves as a representational faculty in the cognitively more sophisticated ones. I draw two morals from this conclusion: first, and against other recent interpretations, that phantasia is primarily the faculty responsible for providing the experiential, qualitative aspects of cognitive episodes; second, and more speculatively, that for Aristotle the representational content of an experience supervenes on its phenomenal character.\n Status: Preliminary Draft  ","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607331142,"objectID":"6e91d9ea5ac6752b5e1330af22da065a","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/research/papers/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/research/papers/","section":"research","summary":"On Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Theory of Perceptual Discrimination Perception and Hypothetical Necessity in Posterior Analytics 2.19 In Posterior Analytics 2.19, Aristotle argues that knowledge of the first principles of a demonstrative science is acquired from the \u0026ldquo;innate discriminative capacity\u0026rdquo; we call perception.","tags":null,"title":"Papers","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PHIL 1440: Philosophy of Mind  Raw Data\r\rQuantitative Feedback    Question Mean S.Dev.

My guiding aim in teaching philosophy is to dispel this tendency by creating the conditions for fruitful struggle with these texts. One of the most valuable aspects of my philosophical training was struggling to understand classic works of philosophy. Confronted with a text I did not immediately understand, I was challenged to ask questions and consider the underlying issues anew, and in doing so I came to appreciate the text for reasons beyond its historical or dialectical significance. The same, I\u0026rsquo;ve found, is true of my students. Given the right tools, a student challenged by a text she does not immediately understand will be encouraged to interrogate it, rather than treat it as something that has already been understood and rightly discarded; she will consider for herself the quality of the reasons given for the view on offer; and she will seize the opportunity to articulate, verbally and in writing, her own assessment of that view.\nMy job as a teacher of philosophy is to equip students with the resources they need to struggle fruitfully with philosophical texts\u0026mdash;in my lectures, in classroom activities, and in student assessment. I design my courses around a model of guided reading. On this model, students' first exposure to the content of an assigned text comes in lecture, where they are presented with concise definitions of the concepts and potted versions of the arguments they will encounter. I distribute slides of my lectures, which I instruct the students to use as an aid to spotting the relevant concepts and arguments as they read. While students often report having difficulty with the reading, they are just as often surprised at how much they\u0026rsquo;ve understood and how clearly they can relate these concepts and arguments in class discussion.\nI supplement this initial guided reading with a variety of classroom activities designed to reinforce and amplify students' comprehension. In one activity, students take turns as \u0026ldquo;lead discussants\u0026rdquo; of pairs of readings arguing on either side of a debate. The readings may be historical, for instance the letters of Descartes and Elisabeth of Bohemia on mind-body interaction; or they may be more contemporary, for instance Smart and Kripke on the identity theory of mind. As lead discussant, the student advocates for one of the opposed positions in class discussion, answering questions and responding to challenges from the other lead discussant, her peers, and me. Students prepare for this role by writing an \u0026ldquo;executive summary\u0026rdquo; of their reading and by rehearsing with me and the other lead discussant in office hours. Students generally report a positive experience as a lead discussant, and they seem to me remarkably fluent in their ability to explain and defend often subtle philosophical positions. Another activity involves tasking pairs of students with producing \u0026ldquo;fair copies\u0026rdquo; of class meetings, polished transcripts of lectures and class discussion compiled from the students' notes and corrected by me. The result is that students construct their own lecture notes as guides for reading and study.\nSimilar aims guide the design of my online and hybrid courses, in which I employ asynchronous methods to guide independent reading and synchronous methods to reinforce comprehension of main ideas of the text. Each unit of the course begins with a prerecorded video lecture introducing students to the topic and providing guides for engaging with the texts, with participation and basic comprehension assessed on the basis of short, multiple-choice quizzes integrated into the lecture. The students are asked to watch the lecture and begin reading the texts in advance of live discussion meetings with me and their peers. In advanced courses, the discussions are structured around student responses to reading questions submitted the day before and graded by me, as well as student presentations of secondary literature. Meetings in introductory courses are more variable in their structure, incorporating discussion of student questions, structured debates, and group activities.\nMy policies for student assessment likewise emphasize fruitful struggle with the assigned texts. An important evaluative tool in all of my courses is argument analysis, in which I ask students to clarify, reconstruct, and formulate objections to arguments in primary sources, following a model I illustrate in my lectures. I stress the importance of writing outlines and preliminary drafts, and I incentivize students to do so by offering to discuss and comment on early outlines and drafts. This policy is beneficial for two reasons. First, revising in light of my comments enables the student to clarify her own understanding of the relevant issues. Moreover, it gives me a basis for evaluating the student\u0026rsquo;s improvement in addition to the quality of the resulting paper. In general I prefer anonymous assessment of exams, but I try as much as possible to use a student\u0026rsquo;s improvement as a basis for evaluating her performance in assignments demanding critical engagement with philosophical texts.\nConsistently positive student feedback on this model testifies to its pedagogical efficacy. In evaluations of my courses, students regularly report that the lecture slides, as well as other \u0026ldquo;preparatory\u0026rdquo; material such as podcasts or YouTube videos, helped them understand the assigned readings and the content of the lectures; that acting as lead discussant enhanced their engagement with the material; and that class assignments such as regular reading responses and composing \u0026ldquo;scribe sheets\u0026rdquo; for the production of fair copies made a positive contribution to their learning experience. I am also encouraged by consistently positive feedback on my performance in the classroom: students often remark on my enthusiasm as a lecturer, my willingness to answer questions both inside and outside of the classroom, and my willingness to discuss and comment on drafts of their assignments. Most recently, in Spring 2020 the positive student feedback on my evaluations exceeded all College and University benchmarks, and in Spring 2019 I was recognized by the Koç University College of Social Sciences and Humanities for teaching excellence.\nAristotle claimed that teachers think they have achieved their goal when they observe their students actually doing what they have been taught. Rightly so. In my view the aim and chief pleasure of teaching philosophy is to observe students doing what they could not do before: reading, with increased understanding and appreciation, some of the great works of the discipline.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"4ba7fdd815889a16653400e5faf45d45","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/dossier/statement/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/dossier/statement/","section":"dossier","summary":"For teachers and students alike, it is all too easy to regard the texts that make up the standard philosophical curriculum as artifacts, relics of views that were once compelling but have since\u0026mdash;perhaps long since\u0026mdash;been superseded.","tags":null,"title":"Teaching Statement","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PHL 340: Issues in Philosophy of Mind: Perception and Singular Thought  Raw Data\r\rQuantitative Feedback    Question Mean S.Dev.

Selected Qualitative Feedback  \u0026ldquo;Robert Howton, a PhD student in the department of Philosophy instructed the entire course. This was the first course he has ever taught. That being said, he did not exhibit any anxiety while instructing the course. He was well-versed in each of the covered topics, as was made evident in his explanation of the difficult subject matter. He provided clear and concise lecture handouts, which essentially covered all of the material in the class. Overall, I can confidently say that Robert Howton was, by far, my favorite instructor at the University of Toronto (PhD candidate, or otherwise).\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Prof. Howton had to teach this course on his own because Prof. Whiting was taking leave. In doing so however he was excellent. He provided us with extremely helpful outlines of his lectures, allowing me to keep attention on him while also adding things down on the handout. While he did sometimes go a bit fast, the minute anyone asked him to repeat a concept he would do so and make it ever the more clear. Though he\u0026rsquo;s a graduate student, I thoroughly enjoyed learning with him as my professor. He definitely demonstrated how interested and enthusiastic he was about the course material, and I would definitely take another course with him in the future. Great job.\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Great, explained clearly the topics. Everything was done slowly so everyone understands. There was a use of many examples. Small class so all questions were answered. Instructor helped out with any problem.\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Robert Howton is a fantastic instructor. The subject matter was very interesting and very intellectually stimulating.\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Robbie always provided a lot of support and tried to go slowly when concepts were unclear.\u0026rdquo;\n ","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574094096,"objectID":"dd1e380d9ea2c82f2b9ac625f2f51202","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/dossier/2014winter/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/dossier/2014winter/","section":"dossier","summary":"PHL 340: Issues in Philosophy of Mind: Perception and Singular Thought  Raw Data\r\rQuantitative Feedback    Question Mean S.Dev.
