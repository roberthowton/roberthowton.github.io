Spurred by the ongoing revolution in science and the rediscovery of some lost works of Classical Greek and Roman philosophy, philosophers of this period turned away from the scholastic disputes practiced in the universities of Europe to a whole new set of philosophical questions, including: What am I? How do I relate to my body? Is knowledge possible? If so, where does it come from? For proponents of this new approach to philosophy, exploration of these questions did not require extensive education or training, only the exercise of one\u0026rsquo;s inborn rational faculties. For this reason, philosophy in this period also witnessed another revolution: the increasing influence of women philosophers.\nThis course will introduce you to the major questions and figures of 17th and 18th century philosophy in Western Europe. We begin with René Descartes, arguably the most important thinker of the 17th century. Descartes' philosophical work posed the questions with which subsequent philosophers would wrestle. After looking at Descartes' answers to these questions, we\u0026rsquo;ll turn to those of his contemporaries and successors, including Malebranche, Cavendish, Leibniz, Berkeley, Locke, and Hume. Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll close our survey with a look at the most important philosopher of the 18th century: Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental philosophy represents the culmination of Descartes' philosophical legacy.\nCourse Objectives This course will emphasize close reading, analysis, and evaluation of basic philosophical works from the early modern period, with the aim of establishing a broad understanding of the philosophical controversies of that period and cultivating the skills necessary for appreciating these and other topics in philosophy. The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate philosophical questions and ideas, both verbally and in writing, to read and critically assess philosophical literature, to identify the elements of an argument and assess it for soundness and validity, and to apply these skills to novel cases.  The key to success in this course is to keep up with the assigned readings and to attend and participate regularly in class activities.\n If you keep up with the lectures and readings you will not be assigned anything for which you are unprepared!   Course Components There are two basic components of this course, lectures and guided reading. Both components are mandatory, and both are moreover crucial for your success in this course.\nLectures The job of my lectures is to introduce you to the theories, concepts, and problems that make up the content of the course. These lectures will be accompanied by slide-show presentations, which I will share with you to use outside of lecture as a guide to reading the assigned texts. Hence, you will not be expected to come to the lecture having read the material assigned for that day, but rather to use what you learn in lecture to help you read the text on your own.\nGuided Reading After attending lecture, you will be responsible for working your way through the assigned readings. The assigned readings are inevitably difficult: they are texts written centuries ago for audiences very different from us, a fact which accounts as much for their enduring interest as their difficulty for modern readers. The lectures are designed to help you as you work out the meaning of the text for yourself, providing you with the necessary context, key ideas, and outlines of important arguments. Your progress in coming to grips with these texts by a series of reading responses assigned for each Unit, which you will turn in for credit one week after the completion of the relevant Unit.\nEvaluation Your success in meeting these objectives will be assessed on the following bases:\n  Completion of five reading responses assigned at the beginning of each Unit and due one week after its completion. The questions assigned in each of the reading responses are designed to orient your reading as well as to gauge your comprehension of the assigned texts.\n  Two 3\u0026ndash;5 page argument analysis papers, each dedicated to an important passage discussed in lecture.\n  Additionally, students will assessed for participation by means of self-assessments prepared by the student after each Unit. See below for more information.\n  Self-Assessment Participation is crucial for grasping the content and developing the skills at which this course aims. However, there are more ways to participate in a course than just verbal, in-class participation, which can also be exclusionary, imprecise to grade, and insensitive to students whose circumstances at home are not optimized for remote learning. Rather than traditional participation, we will use self-assessments to reflect on how we have engage with the course in general, or supported others in their engagement, and how we might improve our efforts. To this end, I will be assigning self-assessment quizzes (on Blackboard) at end of every Unit.\n You are required to fill out a self-assessment for every unit.   I intend to be as inclusive as possible in assessing your efforts to engage with the course. Participation and engagement in the course might include, but are certainly not limited to:\n doing course readings or accessing preparatory material; asking or answering questions in class; contributing to class discussion; engaging with the contributions of others in a charitable and respectful way; discussing course material (in person or online) with others outside of class, including with those not enrolled in this course; starting or contributing to discussions on blogs or social media; seeking out additional resources on course topics, such as articles, books, podcasts, or lectures; taking detailed notes on course readings; sharing your academic strategies, tips, and habits with others; creating and sharing artistic media relating to course content, such as drawings, paintings, poetry, music, comics, videos, podcasts, or short stories; visiting a museum (virtually or in person) or seeking out artistic works in other ways and sharing how these works relate to course topics; reflecting either in writing or in discussion on the relation of course topics to recent news stories, opinion pieces,or magazine articles or to research, theories, or findings from other disciplines.   Our ability to credit you with these modes of engagement depends on your ability to document them, so please be detailed and, if possible, provide evidence!

Initially, Aristotle seems to have proposed a hylomorphic conception of substance to deal with certain challenges to the possibility of change, in particular substantial change, in which there comes to be a human or a house from what was not one before. But the impact of this thesis on Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s thought extends far beyond the resolution of these challenges, influencing most crucially his theory of being in Metaphysics Z, his explanation of life in De Anima, and the whole of the biological theory he develops in the Parts and Generation of Animals.\nThis course will be an in-depth examination of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s hylomorphism, its theoretical motivations, and its philosophical difficulties. We will read widely from Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s works in metaphysics and natural science, while drawing on both recent scholarly and neo-Aristotelian treatments of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of substance.\nCourse Objectives The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s metaphysics and natural science and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and related issues in ancient and contemporary philosophy.\nLearning Outcomes The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s hylomorphism, to read and critically assess relevant primary and secondary literature, to apply these skills to novel cases.   If you keep up with the lectures and readings you will not be assigned anything for which you are unprepared!   Course Components Students' success in meeting these course goals will be evaluated on the following bases:\n  Undergraduate students will be expected to write two passage commentaries of roughly 7 pages each. The commentaries are designed to stimulate in-depth historical and philosophical engagement with one of the major passages discussed in class and the relevant secondary literature. Undergraduates who earn an A- or higher on their first commentary can petition to write a roughly 7 page term paper (Term Paper 2 style; see below) in lieu of a second commentary.\n  Graduate students will be expected to write three roughly 7 page term papers, each addressing a substantive interpretive issue concerning Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s metaphysics, natural science, and/or related philosophical issues. These papers are intended to be exercises in advanced philosophical writing, so students will be responsible for submitting substantial outlines and preliminary drafts, on which I will provide comments aimed at helping the student compose a well-written and cogently argued final draft. Additionally, students will be given progressively greater discretion over the subject of their papers over the course of the term:\n Term Paper 1 topics will be chosen from a list of prompts given by me. Term Paper 2 topics may either be chosen from a list of prompts given by me or proposed by the student in consultation with me. Term Paper 3 topics must be proposed by the student in consultation with me.    Participation will be evaluated on the basis of student participation in discussions both in lecture meetings and outside of lecture meetings in the course chat (see below).\n   Finally, students will give at least two 10\u0026ndash;15 minute in-class presentations. Students due to present in a given week will also be required to post three reading questions to the course chat no later than the Tuesday of that week.

Sometimes, however, things are not as they appear. We see a straight stick in the water as bent, or are taken in by a vivid dream or hallucination, or treat as reliable a source that turns out to peddle fake news. How do these various illusions impact our efforts to learn from experience? What strategies can we adopt\u0026mdash;as individuals, as researchers, and as citizens\u0026mdash;to combat these sorts of error? And what happens when things go right, when our senses teach us how the world really is? This course will explore these and similar questions concerning illusions in their many forms, drawing on resources past and present from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and the sociology of science.\nCourse Objectives This course aims to help students:\n Gain an appreciation for the various forms of illusion and perceptual error and their significance in our cognitive lives; Come to understand the cultural and historical influences shaping our notions of illusion, perception, and reality; and Think freely and critically about how these issues affect them as individuals, researchers, and citizens.  Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the successful student will have demonstrated the ability to:\n express philosophical ideas clearly, both verbally and in writing; read and critically assess philosophical and other academic literature; identify the elements of an argument and assess it for soundness and validity; and apply these skills to novel cases.  The key to success in this course is to keep up with the assigned readings and to attend and participate regularly in class activities.\n If you keep up with the lectures and readings you will not be assigned anything for which you are unprepared!   Course Logistics This course will be taught remotely this semester. In accordance with University guidelines, all class meetings will be held on Zoom, recorded, and posted to the course Blackboard page after the fact. This policy is intended to accommodate students who are unable to attend class meetings when they are held, not as a substitute for attendance and participation in class meetings.\nClass time will be divided between lecture meetings, which will take place Tuesdays and Thursdays, and discussion meetings, which will take place on Fridays.\n The purpose of lecture meetings is to introduce course material and prepare you for reading the texts assigned for that Unit. You should come to the first lecture meeting of the week having engaged with the preparatory material; after the first meeting, you\u0026rsquo;ll be in a position to start with the assigned reading. The purpose of discussion meetings is to give you the opportunity to discuss ideas and problems arising from the lecture and assignments with a smaller group of your peers. Discussions will be led by one of the course TAs. You should come having completed the readings and other assignments due that week. Ideally, you will also come with questions for discussion. Attendance at these meetings is mandatory and enforced by weekly quizzes.   Philosophy is, and has always been, a discursive enterprise. Without testing your understanding of the ideas and theories you\u0026rsquo;re exposed to in class through questions and thoughtful discussion with your peers, \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n -- Course Components Each student\u0026rsquo;s success in meeting the course objectives and learning outcomes will be assessed on the following bases:\n Students will be expected to earn a Master of Illusion Certificate from the University of Glasgow. Additionally, students will be expected to write three short papers responding to questions about assigned readings and other course material. Students unsatisfied with their initial score on a short paper assignment may write a second draft addressing problems identified by instructor/TA comments on the first draft; the student\u0026rsquo;s final grade on that short paper assignment will then be the average of the first and second draft grades. Additionally, students will assessed for attendance and participation:  Attendance in discussion meetings will be assessed by weekly quizzes administered during discussion meetings, which will the readings assigned for that week. Participation will be assessed by means of self-assessments prepared by the student after each Unit. See below for more information.    Self-Assessment Participation is crucial for grasping the content and developing the skills at which this course aims.

So far, however, no commentators have addressed\nAgainst recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination:  Answering these questions leads us to reject two claims central to many recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination in Aristotle:  That Aristotle regards being κριτική as essential to, or partially definitive of, αἴσθησις: see most recently Perälä, but also by Ebert, De Haas [CHECK Corcilius, Herzberg, Johansen] That Aristotle, in stressing that αἴσθησις is κριτική, is emphasizing that the power to perceive is, in some primary sense, a power to discriminate or tell apart sensible qualities and sensible bodies. (A line of interpretation initially proposed by Ebert but which has been accepted by all [?] subsequent interpreters.)    In contrast, I\u0026rsquo;ll argue that:   The power to discriminate is not a feature of the essence of the senses, but rather a demonstrable feature of them.\n  Aristotle provides two arguments aimed at demonstrating that αἴσθησις is κριτική, one final causal and one formal causal:\n According to the final causal argument, αἴσθησις is and must be κριτική in order to promote the ends for whose sake it belongs to living things that have αἴσθησις:  αἴσθησις is present in all animals for the sake of survival and, ultimately, reproduction; the presence of αἴσθησις additionally promotes animals' cognitive function; finally, in humans, αἴσθησις is cited as the capacity from which potential knowers acquire knowledge of the indemonstrable principles of a demonstrative science.   According to the formal causal argument, αἴσθησις is κριτική because each sense (αἴσθησις) is a mean state of the opposition present in the qualities each perceives, and the mean is in every case κριτική.    Seen in the light of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s arguments, the conclusion that αἴσθησις is κριτική appears radically different: not an affirmation that perception is the cognition of difference but of the basic fidelity of the senses. For Aristotle, the senses are not only a source of knowledge; perception itself is a form of knowledge. And the basis for this claim is that perception, in its most basic form, is criterial for the presence of the sensible qualities it perceives; that perceivers, by virtue of having the capacity to perceive, occupy a privileged perspective with respect to the sensible objects and qualities of which they are critical.\n  Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s predecessors on perceptual κρίσις Anaxagoras Democritus Plato Aristotle in response to his predecessors Two arguments for perceptual κρίσις The final causal argument The formal causal argument Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Protagoreanism Concluding remarks The foregoing has sketched a fragment of a debate whose origin and terminus far exceed the scope of this paper. At its inception is a pre-Platonic skepticism about the reliability of the senses, at its terminus a sophisticated between skeptics and so-called dogmatists about the status of perception as a \u0026ldquo;criterion of truth\u0026rdquo; and source of knowledge. My hope is that this paper has shown that Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s case for the fidelity of the senses is more formative for this debate than we have previously acknowledged.\n","date":1557910347,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1574094096,"objectID":"6968f96a0db909cf430c8fb8bc642fbd","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/post/krisis/","publishdate":"2019-05-15T11:52:27+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/krisis/","section":"post","summary":"Table of Contents  Introduction Against recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination: In contrast, I\u0026rsquo;ll argue that: Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s predecessors on perceptual κρίσις  Anaxagoras Democritus Plato   Aristotle in response to his predecessors Two arguments for perceptual κρίσις  The final causal argument The formal causal argument   Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Protagoreanism Concluding remarks   Introduction In several passages of his natural scientific treatises, Aristotle expresses commitment to the thesis that sense-perception (aisthêsis) is kritikê, discriminative or (better, as I shall argue) criterial.","tags":[],"title":"Aristotle's Arguments for the Perceptual Criterion","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Stemma \u0026amp; Sigla Families          α ECcXyLHaMoBpOaWzvZaNCaUSOdW + (until approximately 442b26) V   β BePΓ2   γ XyLHaMoBpOaWzvZaNCaUSOdW + (until approximately 442b26) V   δ XyLHa + (until approximately 444b1) MoOaBpWz   ε vZaNCaUSOdW + (from approximately 444b1) MoOaBpWz + (until approximately 442b26) V   λ XyLHa   ν LHa   μ MoOaBpWz   A vZa   π N + (until approximately 442b26) V   η SOdW    Manuscripts          E Paris. gr. 1853, mid-10th century   Cc Paris.

More often than not, philosophers have sought the answer to this question by looking to the nature of perceptual experience itself, asking for instance whether perception is a relation, what accounts for the phenomenal or qualitative character of perceptual experience, and how perceptual experiences manage to represent a mind-independent reality. In this course we will take a different starting point: the nature of the objects of perception themselves. Our primary focus will be color, a phenomenon that seems, paradoxically, at once the most familiar and most incomprehensible feature of the world familiar to our experience. Beginning with the science of color vision and the relation between the familiar hues and the structure of our visual system, we\u0026rsquo;ll go on to consider questions of the nature of the colors, their relation to the physical properties of objects that appear colored, and how visual experience gives us knowledge of them. With any luck, we\u0026rsquo;ll also have opportunity to discuss other sensible qualities, for instance sound.\nCourse Objectives The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in the philosophy of color perception and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and other issues in the philosophy of mind and perception.\nLearning Outcomes The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to the philosophy of perception, to read and critically assess relevant literature, to apply these skills to novel cases.

The first, which develops themes from my dissertation, concerns Aristotle’s views on the epistemic value of sense perception. The second concerns the status of soul as an explanatory principle in Aristotle’s natural science. Below I provide an overview of these topics. In Papers I detail some papers in progress or projected on these and related topics, and in Book Project I outline a book project, Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination, that draws together the major topics of my research.\nAristotle\u0026rsquo;s Theory of Perceptual Discrimination Aristotle conceives of perception as a process that is at once causal and “cognitive,” a means by which the perceiver comes to know something about the world. Disputes over perception’s causal aspect have roiled for decades, but until recently little scholarly attention has been paid to its cognitive aspect. I aim to increase our understanding of this crucial aspect of Aristotle’s celebrated theory of perception by elucidating one of its most important and contentious theses: that perception is a discriminative capacity of soul.\nI laid the foundations for this project in my doctoral dissertation, Aristotle’s Case for Perceptual Knowledge. Against a range of competing interpretations, I argued that Aristotle’s thesis, and the theory of perceptual discrimination he develops in support of it, is a direct response to a well-known Platonic argument against perceptual knowledge. To say, for instance, that sight “discriminates” color is on Aristotle’s view to say that seeing the color of a body is a way of knowing its color. This interpretation, I argued, enables us to see why Aristotle thinks it is by discriminating that the senses promote animals’ diverse practical and intellectual goals, and so why he also rejects the view, almost universally accepted by his predecessors, that perception is an impediment to knowledge.\nI am at work on a series of papers elaborating this approach to the cognitive aspect of perception in Aristotle’s psychology, the ontology of color and other sensible qualities on which it relies, and its role in teleological explanations of the value of perception for rational and non-rational animals. One paper, \u0026ldquo;Reduction and Revelation in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Science of Sensible Qualities\u0026rdquo;, will be published in a volume currently in preparation on Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s De Sensu. Another, “Perception and Hypothetical Necessity in Posterior Analytics 2.19,\u0026quot; is being revised for resubmission to Ancient Philosophy. Additionally, I am planning a book, Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination, aimed at situating Aristotle’s theory of perceptual discrimination within his general teleological approach to explaining the natural attributes of living things by reference to the contributions those attributes make to the ends living things naturally pursue.\nSoul as a \u0026ldquo;Complex Activity\u0026rdquo; in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Natural Science Commentators have found a conflict between the theory and explanatory practice of Aristotle’s biology. In theory, the soul of a living thing\u0026mdash;its form and essence\u0026mdash;is supposed to explain each of its natural attributes, but in practice Aristotle seems to admit that some of a living thing’s natural attributes are due, not to its soul, but to its matter. I argue that this conflict is only apparent. We can see the soul as the basis even of these explanations if we take seriously Aristotle’s claim that the soul is a “certain complex activity,” a diverse collection of vital functions aimed at a single, teleologically primary goal, such as reproduction.\nI am at work on a series of papers aimed at elucidating this “complex activity” model of soul and its role in Aristotle’s natural science. The first, which appears in Murgier, Louguet, and Guyomarc’h (eds.), Aristote et l’âme humaine. Lectures de De Anima III offertes à Michel Crubellier (Peeters, 2020), argues that Aristotle uses the complex activity model in De Anima to explain the psychological attributes of living things. In subsequent papers, I plan to extend this interpretation to Aristotle’s explanations of animals’ physiological attributes in the Generation of Animals and the Parts of Animals, where the soul is presented respectively as the efficient and final cause of these attributes.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"bc8c75ec10f4acb491c3299f2f23af66","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/research/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"research","summary":"Overview My current research focuses on two related topics in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s psychology and natural philosophy.

For many epistemologists, both ancient and modern, whether and how knowledge is attainable depends on whether we possess some criterion or standard by which to judge what is the case from what merely appears to be the case. This idea, that knowledge requires a criterion of truth, has its origins in antiquity, in Hellenistic debates between so-called Dogmatists and Skeptics about whether human beings possess\u0026mdash;or can ever possess\u0026mdash;such a criterion. Our aim in this course will be to explore the ancient roots of this \u0026ldquo;problem of the criterion\u0026rdquo;, in order to gain a better understanding of the various arguments and positions of the dogmatic and skeptical Hellenistic schools, as well as the prehistory of this debate in Hellenic figures such as Protagoras, Democritus, and, more controversially, Plato and Aristotle.\nCourse Objectives The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in ancient epistemology and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and other issues in ancient and contemporary philosophy.\nLearning Outcomes The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to ancient epistemology, to read and critically assess relevant primary and secondary literature, to apply these skills to novel cases.

The final paper will address a substantive interpretive issue concerning Hellenistic epistemology and/or related philosophical issues. Topics and secondary literature will be selected in consultation with me.\n  Class participation will be evaluated on the basis of the student\u0026rsquo;s answer to periodic reading response questions, which will be distributed in advance and must be turned in prior to the start of the meeting in which the relevant reading is to be discussed.

I argue that the explanatory role of the soul in Aristotle’s natural science must be understood in light of his view, stated in a controversial passage from _Parts of Animals_ (645b14–20), that the soul of a living thing is a “complex activity” of its organic body. This paper explores the role of this “complex activity” model of soul in Aristotle’s study of soul in _De Anima_. I argue, first, that the model has its origins in _De Anima_ II.4, where Aristotle argues that living things do all they do by nature for the sake of a single, teleologically primary end. I argue further that Aristotle uses this model to account for the psychological attributes naturally present in living things, including their capacities for vital activities like nutrition, reproduction, and perception, and that this is the task to which Aristotle devotes the obscure final chapters of _De Anima_ III.","tags":null,"title":"Why De Anima Needs III 12-13","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598013775,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612517334,"objectID":"4a4720f7644ed3fde75ed4f65155fe9b","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/illusion/","publishdate":"2020-08-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/illusion/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"Illusion: When Appearances Deceive","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612517334,"objectID":"461c688f0c0f86a4d5ceee9646b9abe3","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/hylomorphism/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/hylomorphism/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Current Courses"],"title":"Aristotle's Hylomorphism","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601042670,"objectID":"00b42fa4af85f4135364d57e8202883b","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/aristotles-soul/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/aristotles-soul/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"Aristotle's Soul","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601042670,"objectID":"732511d730794cae55e9ca45c42dabeb","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/color/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/color/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"Color and Color Experience","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612517334,"objectID":"fb76538064abf55c21a0dfd38f61c003","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/modern/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/modern/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Current Courses"],"title":"Early Modern Philosophy","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1579610575,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601042670,"objectID":"ee7846cf297889fe92e070e76c3b369e","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/criterion/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T12:42:55Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/criterion/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"The Problem of the Criterion","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How to Write a Philosophy Paper  The Goal of a Philosophy Paper  Question What makes a philosophy paper successful?\n \rAnswer\rA successful philosophy paper does two things:\n\r\r1. It makes an argument for a specific claim; i.e., it defends a thesis!\r\r\r2. The argument it makes is intelligible and convincing to the reader as well.\r\r Planning a Successful Philosophy Paper  \r Step 1: Select a thesis \r\r\r Exercise: What theses address the TP1 prompt? \r What is the objection Elisabeth is raising for Cartesian dualism, and how does Descartes respond to it? Is Elisabeth’s objection successful? Why, or why not?\n \r \rStep 2: Develop an argument for that thesis.\r\r\rThree forms of argument\r 1. Deductive [Must be Valid and Sound!] \rAll humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Moose is a dog. Moose does not have fleas. Therefore, not all dogs have fleas.\n\r\rThree forms of argument\r 2. Inductive [Sample Must be Representative!]\ra, b, c, and d are all Fs which are also G. Therefore, all Fs are Gs.\n\r\rThree forms of argument\r3. Abductive [Must be Best Available Explanation!]\rIncrease in carbon emissions correlates with increasingly rapid climate change; there is no other correlation which could better explain increasingly rapid climate change; therefore, increase in carbon emissions causes climate change.\n\r\rExercise: What argument(s) support the theses that address the TP1 prompt?\r(Hint: by identifying the form of argument Descartes is giving, we can develop a strategy for supporting or undermining it.)\n\r \rStep 3: Construct an outline\r\r\r(Hint: your outline should present the argument in a way that your peers can understand.)\r\r\rElements of an outline\rI. Introduction\rIntroduces the problem/question; draws in the reader; states thesis.\n\r\rElements of an outline\rII. Exegesis [Optional]\rAdds any other relevant information that the reader must know in order to understand the argument to come.\n\r\rElements of an outline\rIII. Body\rStates, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the argument for the thesis.\n\r\rElements of an outline\rIV. Conclusion\rProvides extremely brief restatement of thesis and argument for it; convinces the reader of the significance of the paper\u0026rsquo;s conclusion(s)\n\r\rExercise: Construct an outline for the TP1 thesis you've chosen.\r(Hints: If you\u0026rsquo;re arguing that Descartes' response is successful, why is the most convincing argument against his conclusion incorrect? If you\u0026rsquo;re arguing that his argument is unsuccessful, where does the argument go wrong?)\n\r \rStep 4: Fill in your outline with complete sentences\r\r\r(Hint: Ideally, the most nested items in each \u0026ldquo;branch\u0026rdquo; of your outline will correspond to a single paragraph.)\n\r Developing Philosophical Writing Skills  Tips for Writing Philosophy  Get to the point!

Argument reconstructions \rTake an argumentative passage, identify the premises and conclusion, and restate the argument in your own words.\n\r\rSample Passage 1: The Cartesian Circle (AT 214)\rMy only remaining concern is whether the author does not commit a vicious circle when he says that we have no other basis on which to establish that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true, than that God exists. But we can be certain that God exists only because we clearly and evidently perceive this fact. Therefore, before we are certain that God exists, we ought to be certain that whatever we clearly and evidently perceive is true.\n\r\rSample Passage 2: Malebranche on the one true cause\rThe motive force of bodies is therefore not in the bodies that are moved, for this motive force is nothing other than the will of God. Thus bodies have no action; and when a moving ball collides with and moves another, it communicates to it nothing of its own, for it does not itself have the force it communicates. However, a ball is the natural cause of the motion it communicates. A natural cause is therefore not a real and true but only an occasional cause, one that determines the Author of nature to act in such and such a manner in such and such a situation.

The book, Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination, will be the first dedicated study of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s thesis that the senses are discriminative capacities of soul. While this thesis has received greater attention from commentators in recent years, it has for the most part been considered in isolation from its context in the explanatory project of the Aristotelian life sciences, and read instead as part of an attempt to explain the character of ordinary perceptual experience. I argue that this has been a mistake. For Aristotle, the significance of the thesis that the senses are discriminative capacities concerns precisely the teleological role of sense perception in animal life. To the question, why do animals perceive in the ways they do?, Aristotle has a single, univocal answer: because the senses are discriminative capacities. By this, Aristotle means that the senses belong to the animals that have them because discriminating by means of those senses promotes the achievement of the ends those animals naturally pursue. Understanding Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s thesis that the senses discriminate therefore requires understanding how Aristotle thinks sensory discrimination contributes to goals that structure animal life.\nThe book defends a novel answer to this question. For Aristotle, discriminating a sensible quality by means of the sense that perceives it is a way of knowing that quality\u0026mdash;a state Aristotle understands as one in which the perceiver is presented with the cause of a perceptual experience as that cause essentially is. For this reason, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s argument for the thesis that the senses are discriminative capacities is a case for regarding perception as a kind of knowledge.\nI present Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s case as a response to two historical challenges, Democritean Eliminativism and Platonic Intellectualism. According to Democritean Eliminativism, sensible qualities such as colors and flavors cannot be objects of knowledge because they are not genuine causes but rather effects on a perceiver\u0026mdash;a view that in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s estimation amounts to the denial that sensible qualities exist at all. According to Platonic Intellectualism, even if the senses put the perceiver in touch with genuine causes, perception of sensible qualities cannot amount to knowledge of these qualities, since only the soul by itself can \u0026ldquo;discriminate\u0026rdquo; the being of the qualities perceived by the senses.\nPart 1: Against Democritean Eliminativism Against Democritean Eliminativism, Aristotle defends a thoroughly realist and objectivist conception of sensible qualities. On his view, colors, flavors, and other sensible qualities are identical to the perceiver-independent causal features of sensible bodies that enable them to produce experiences of those qualities in us. Chapter 1 argues that this conception of sensible qualities should be distinguished from Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s discussion in De Anima of sensible objects, which are perceiver-dependent in a way sensible qualities are not. Chapter 2 defends an interpretation of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of the essence of sensible qualities in De Sensu. I argue that Aristotle defends a physicalist conception of sensible qualities. But unlike modern physicalists, Aristotle denies that there is a necessary contrast between the way a perceptual quality appears in experience and the way it essentially is. Since a perceptual quality is “mixture and motion,” it can appear in experience as the perceiver-independent property it essentially is.\nPart 2: Against Platonic Intellectualism Chapters 3\u0026ndash;5 detail Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s response to Platonic Intellectualism. As Aristotle sees it, the challenge is to show that the senses themselves can discriminate the sensible qualities they perceive. I argue that Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of the sensory capacities of the soul are designed in part to meet this challenge. Chapter 3 considers Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view that the senses are like \u0026ldquo;ratios\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;mean states\u0026rdquo; of the qualities they perceive, a claim that forms the basis of an argument demonstrating that the senses discriminate. On the interpretation I provide, the senses are mean states because each is the form and final cause of an organ that, qua organ of that sense, instantiates the objective mean of the scale of qualities that sense perceives. This interpretation sets up a question about the nature of perceptual affection\u0026mdash;one that has received abundant attention from scholars in recent decades. Chapter 4 addresses this question with a novel proposal. Perceptual affection is neither a literal alteration of the sense organ nor a purely formal or \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; change. It is not a change at all, but an affection whose nature is exhausted by the activity of a sensible quality and excludes any alteration of the organ\u0026mdash;a process Aristotle in another context compares to getting a sunburn or growing red from embarrassment.\nDrawing on this conception of the sensory mean state, Chapter 5 presents Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s argument demonstrating that the senses discriminate. The demonstration is initially obscure, but Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s reasoning is illuminated by an analogy with his celebrated doctrine of the ethical mean. Because virtue is a mean state, vicious actions and emotions appear to the virtuous person as what they essentially are, namely excessive or deficient. Similarly, because each sense is a mean state, the qualities it perceives appear to it as what they essentially are, namely light or dark, sweet or bitter, or more generally as occupying the objective position on the quality scale that defines each as the quality it is. For a sense to “discriminate” a perceptual quality, then, is for that quality to appear to the sensory mean state as what it essentially is.\nPart 3: The Significance of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Perceptual Epistemology The final part of the book explores the psychological, epistemological, and historical consequences of this conception of perceptual discrimination. Chapter 6 considers the unity of the senses in numerically one and the same perceptual capacity and the consequent ability of perceivers both to make discriminations across sensory modalities and to perceive the unity of sensible qualities in a single sensible body. While Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s much-discussed attempts to account for these advanced forms of perceptual discrimination may fail, I argue that they provide indirect support for the present interpretation of sensory discrimination. For the theoretical limitations that seem to prevent Aristotle from providing a satisfactory account of these forms of perceptual discrimination stem from a conception of the senses that, I argue, Aristotle takes to be central to his demonstrative account of sensory discrimination.\nChapter 7 considers Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s claim that perception is a gnôsis tis, a mode of \u0026ldquo;cognition\u0026rdquo; or knowledge. While this claim has led many commentators to conclude that Aristotle has an \u0026ldquo;implicitly graded\u0026rdquo; notion of cognition, on the present interpretation perception turns out to be a full-fledged cognitive capacity, standing in relation to sensible qualities as scientific knowledge, craft knowledge, and nous do to their respective objects. In support of this reading, I consider Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s teleological explanations of sense perception in non-rational animals in De Anima and De Sensu, drawing on Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s conception of soul as a \u0026ldquo;complex activity\u0026rdquo; organized in the pursuit of a single, teleologically primary end. I also consider the role of perception in scientific inquiry in the Posterior Analytics, arguing that the \u0026ldquo;prior knowledge\u0026rdquo; provided by perception from which rational perceivers come to know the first principles of a science consists in knowledge of the causes of particular sensory experiences.\nFinally, Chapter 8 provides a historical epilogue to the foregoing discussion of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s theory of perceptual discrimination. I argue that, in responding to Democritean Eliminativism and Platonic Intellectualism, Aristotle sees himself as reviving a Protagorean conception of perception as a measure or \u0026ldquo;criterion\u0026rdquo; for objects' possession of sensible qualities, although one which respects a thoroughly realist and objectivist ontology. Understanding Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s perceptual epistemology in this way, I argue, brings it into close contact with next-generation debates over whether the senses or our sensory impressions can serve as \u0026ldquo;criteria of truth,\u0026rdquo; a result that promises to shed new light on the development of Hellenistic epistemology.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"89ff084a5be25d214368c0582ab90932","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/research/book/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/research/book/","section":"research","summary":"Aristotle on Perceptual Discrimination After \u0026ldquo;Aristotle on Why the Senses Discriminate\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Aristotle on the End of an Organism\u0026rsquo;s Nature\u0026rdquo; are accepted for publication, I plan to write a book manuscript that draws together both major topics of my research.","tags":null,"title":"Book Project","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Teaching at the University of Toronto (located in the heart of a richly multicultural city), the University of Pittsburgh (with its large and international student body), and Koç University (where almost none of the students share my linguistic or cultural upbringing) has given me experience with students from a wide variety of cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds and of different philosophical abilities. In my view, engaging with such a diversity of perspectives is one of the pleasures of teaching philosophy. But I also believe that a diverse student body places special responsibilities on a teacher of philosophy, who must be sensitive to the different needs of students as they approach philosophical texts, aware of the cultural presuppositions of major philosophical figures that may not be shared by all students, and willing to confront the perception that philosophy is a devotion exclusive to affluent white men.\nI am committed to facilitating fruitful engagement with philosophical texts for students of all cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds, and in my teaching I take measures to promote every student\u0026rsquo;s interest and success in her philosophical education. First, I make an effort to maximize the diversity of my syllabi in courses on the history of philosophy as well as on contemporary topics. While this may seem harder to do in the history of philosophy, I have found success incorporating women philosophers and philosophers of color in developing and teaching syllabi for ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. In the medieval and modern periods we are fortunate to have correspondence of some of those periods' major figures\u0026mdash;including Abelard, Descartes, Leibniz, and Locke\u0026mdash;with lesser-known women philosophers, including Héloïse, Elizabeth of Bohemia, and Margaret Cavendish. I think these correspondence are valuable teaching tools and I make them a central feature of my introductory course on modern philosophy. The ancient period is more difficult, in particular since almost nothing survives from women intellectuals of that period. However, in my teaching I try to stress the significance of medieval Arabic and North African philosophers (who are also worthy of study in their own right) on the transmission and interpretation of ancient philosophers, especially Aristotle, as well the important role that women philosophers and philosophers of color have played in advancing current our understanding of ancient philosophical texts.\nI believe diversifying syllabi benefits students in at least two ways. First, it demonstrates the variety of perspectives that have shaped and continue to shape the discipline. Second, it exposes students to philosophical themes in ways that may be more compelling and relevant to their experience. For instance, the unit on metaphysics in my introduction to philosophy course frames issues concerning essence and human nature in terms of contemporary debates about the relationship between our biological nature as human beings and other aspects of our respective identities, including race and disability. By presenting fundamental metaphysical questions through the work of minority philosophers like Charles Mills and Elizabeth Barnes, I aim to show students that even abstract philosophical questions can bear on issues relevant to their own lives.\nA second measure I take, especially when teaching the history of philosophy, is to ensure that all students are provided with the historical and cultural context necessary for understanding course material. The importance of this practice was impressed on me several years ago, when, as a TA for a course on early medieval philosophy, an international student asked me to explain what is distinctive about the Christian God. What surprised me about the question was that I had assumed\u0026mdash;wrongly\u0026mdash;that my students shared the same broad familiarity with the religious context of medieval Christian philosophers that I received from my own upbringing. From then on, I have striven to reflect critically on the assumptions I bring to my presentation of especially classical philosophical texts, and as far as possible to make those assumptions explicit for the benefit of those who do not share my cultural background.\nFinally, I take measures in student evaluation to counteract my own implicit biases and to encourage the success of students who, for various reasons, struggle with English academic prose. In general, I rely on anonymous grading as much as possible, and I encourage students who would benefit from alternative forms of evaluation to work with me to develop a suitable approach to their assessment, whether it involves verbal testing by one-on-one discussion with me, take home reports, or other means. However, one form of evaluation I\u0026rsquo;ve insisted on is writing. In many cases, I think it is a disservice to students not to use a philosophy course as a vehicle for improving skills as important as prose composition. Nevertheless, I also recognize that some students have greater educational deficits to overcome in their writing than others. I have various ways of helping these students improve their writing and succeed in my courses, including encouraging them to seek help from me in drafting papers, taking time to correct grammar in grading drafts, and (when necessary) exercising lenience in penalizing poor grammar to encourage students to express their philosophical ideas to the best of their ability.\nThere is more I can do to encourage the interest and success in philosophy of a diverse student body, and I am interested in learning and testing new methods for doing so. I see philosophy as a \u0026ldquo;big tent\u0026rdquo; discipline, one that can and ought to welcome a diversity of perspectives. As a white, cisgender male, I believe my role in advancing this conception of the discipline is to give a platform for voices different from my own to make their contribution.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"2a78cd5670ce8078c86c9cd566fbbed7","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/dossier/diversity/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/dossier/diversity/","section":"dossier","summary":"Teaching at the University of Toronto (located in the heart of a richly multicultural city), the University of Pittsburgh (with its large and international student body), and Koç University (where almost none of the students share my linguistic or cultural upbringing) has given me experience with students from a wide variety of cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds and of different philosophical abilities.","tags":null,"title":"Diversity Statement","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  A caption   --\rThis section provides evidence for my effectiveness in teaching drawn from student evaluations.

On a straightforward reading, his argument is conspicuously bad, failing specifically to rule out a rival innatist position that would have appeared viable both in his view and in that of his likely opponents. My aim in this paper is to show that Aristotle can be credited with a more satisfactory and, by his lights, cogent argument if we read it as an appeal to a distinctively natural scientific form of explanation, what Aristotle sometimes calls \u0026ldquo;hypothetical necessity.\u0026rdquo; In doing so, however, I argue that we must also come to see that Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s conception of the role of perception in coming to know first principles is rooted in substantive and controversial psychological theses that find support, not in the foregoing chapters of the Posterior Analytics, but in natural scientific works like De Anima and the Parva Naturalia.\n Status: Revise \u0026amp; Resubmit  Revelation and Reduction in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Science of Sensible Qualities Aristotle shares with modern physicalists the view that colors and other sensible qualities are identical to the properties that cause us to experience them. Unlike modern physicalists, however, Aristotle does not conclude from this that ordinary sense experience therefore cannot \u0026ldquo;reveal\u0026rdquo; to us what sensible qualities essentially are. In this paper, I propose to explain why. The reason, I contend, is not just that Aristotle’s physics is radically different from our own. To be sure, Aristotle does not see the same structural disanalogies between the world as we experience it and as it is described by fundamental physics, but for him too the identification of sensible qualities with the causes of sense experience is reductive, an attempt to explain sensible qualities in terms of more general\u0026mdash;and scientifically sophisticated\u0026mdash;causal connections. Nevertheless, for Aristotle the value of sense perception consists in its ability to make perceivers aware of the physical properties responsible for those experiences. In defending this view, I argue, Aristotle articulates a conception of perceptual knowledge that is both interesting in its own right and provides a novel justification for the intuitive thesis that experience of sensible qualities reveals, in some way or other, what those qualities essentially are.\n Status: Accepted by Editor, Revisions Pending; Draft Available Upon Request  Aristotle on Why the Senses Discriminate Aristotle regards the senses as \u0026ldquo;discriminative\u0026rdquo; (kritikê), capacities not only to be affected by and perceive sensible qualities, but also to \u0026ldquo;discriminate and cognize something that is.\u0026rdquo; Commentators since antiquity have tended to make two assumptions about the sensory capacity to discriminate: first that it is a capacity the senses have essentially, and second that its exercise results in a certain sort of experience, e.g. as of the difference between sensible qualities or their unity in a sensible body. I argue that both assumptions are mistaken. First, I argue that the capacity to discriminate is not essential but a scientifically knowable attribute of the senses, and that in De Anima Aristotle offers two arguments explaining why the senses discriminate, one final causal and one formal causal. Second, I argue that the capacity these arguments attribute to the senses is epistemically far richer than commentators have supposed: the capacity to become aware of the mind-independent features of sensible bodies.\n Status: In Progress  On Soul as a \u0026ldquo;Complex Activity\u0026rdquo; in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Natural Science Aristotle on the End of an Organism\u0026rsquo;s Nature In at least four passages of the corpus, Aristotle appeals to what we might term the \u0026ldquo;natural end\u0026rdquo; of an organism. The notion is evidently significant for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s approach to the life sciences, appearing decisively in explanations of phenomena such as animal perception and the observable order of embryonic development. However, both the notion and its explanatory role have been neglected in recent studies of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s natural teleology. This paper develops an interpretation of the natural end of an organism and its explanatory role in the Aristotelian life sciences, in an effort to prepare the way for a full appreciation of this important feature of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s natural teleology.\nOn the interpretation I defend, the natural end of an organism is the realization of the natural activity for whose sake that organism possesses and engages in each of the activities it is naturally capable of engaging in. So understood, the notion of an organism\u0026rsquo;s natural end is bound intimately to a conception of organic life, and hence of the soul, as a complex of activities unified in the pursuit of a single, teleologically primary activity. This \u0026ldquo;complex activity model\u0026rdquo; of soul originates in De Anima, but its explanatory implications reach to Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account of organic development and morphology, accounting in particular for the developmental priority the parts of the animal body through the use of which the animal achieves the \u0026ldquo;goal that is the function of its nature.\u0026rdquo;\n Status: In Progress  Material Nature in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Parts of Animals Biological kinds are thought to pose a special problem for Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s approach to explanation. The problem is that some physiological attributes naturally belonging to living things seem not to be explained by their soul\u0026mdash;their form and essence\u0026mdash;but by their matter. I argue that the problem is only apparent, and that we can see the soul as the basis of even these explanations if we take into account Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s claim in Parts of Animals 1.5 (645b28\u0026ndash;646a2) that the organic parts of a living body stand in teleological relations that mirror those of the psychic activities for which they are instruments. On the basis of this claim, I argue that the soul accounts for a living thing\u0026rsquo;s physiological attributes as both an efficient cause of its coming to be and the final cause of its being. I support this interpretation by showing that the parallel relations of teleological priority among psychic capacities and their material organs explain, first of all, the order in which the parts of the animal body are said to develop in Generation of Animals, and second, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s appeal to \u0026ldquo;material nature\u0026rdquo; in some controversial passages of Parts of Animals.\n Status: Projected  On Other Topics in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Psychology Hearing Speech Incidentally: An Aristotelian Distinction Concerning Perceptual Content There is a familiar difference between the experience of hearing a language one understands and the experience of hearing a language one doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand. But theorists disagree on how this contrast is reflected in the content of these auditory experiences. Conservative approaches take the difference to concern non-semantic properties of the linguistic utterance, including low-level properties (such as pitch and timbre) as well as language-specific properties (such as being this or that phoneme). Liberal approaches, by contrast, take the difference also to concern whether the subject hears, or fails to hear, the meaning of the relevant utterance. I argue for a moderate approach, taking my point of departure from the Aristotelian idea that the meaning of a linguistic utterance is audible, but only \u0026ldquo;incidentally\u0026rdquo; so. I argue that this approach avoids the difficulties facing both the conservative and liberal approaches, and moreover provides a model for a broadly speaking Aristotelian theory of perceptual content that warrants serious consideration in its own right.\n Status: Preliminary Draft  Aristotle on Why Animals Have Phantasia Aristotle gives contradictory answers to the question whether all animals have phantasia (imagination). But while some commentators have claimed that Aristotle ultimately defends a positive or negative answer to the question, I argue that his ambivalence is well-motivated. Aristotle is pulled in different directions because he attributes two distinct roles to phantasia. In all animals it is responsible for the phenomenal character of experience, but it also serves as a representational faculty in the cognitively more sophisticated ones. I draw two morals from this conclusion: first, and against other recent interpretations, that phantasia is primarily the faculty responsible for providing the experiential, qualitative aspects of cognitive episodes; second, and more speculatively, that for Aristotle the representational content of an experience supervenes on its phenomenal character.\n Status: Preliminary Draft  ","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607331142,"objectID":"6e91d9ea5ac6752b5e1330af22da065a","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/research/papers/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/research/papers/","section":"research","summary":"On Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Theory of Perceptual Discrimination Perception and Hypothetical Necessity in Posterior Analytics 2.19 In Posterior Analytics 2.19, Aristotle argues that knowledge of the first principles of a demonstrative science is acquired from the \u0026ldquo;innate discriminative capacity\u0026rdquo; we call perception.","tags":null,"title":"Papers","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PHIL 1440: Philosophy of Mind  Raw Data\r\rQuantitative Feedback    Question Mean S.Dev.

My guiding aim in teaching philosophy is to dispel this tendency by creating the conditions for fruitful struggle with these texts. One of the most valuable aspects of my philosophical training was struggling to understand classic works of philosophy. Confronted with a text I did not immediately understand, I was challenged to ask questions and consider the underlying issues anew, and in doing so I came to appreciate the text for reasons beyond its historical or dialectical significance. The same, I\u0026rsquo;ve found, is true of my students. Given the right tools, a student challenged by a text she does not immediately understand will be encouraged to interrogate it, rather than treat it as something that has already been understood and rightly discarded; she will consider for herself the quality of the reasons given for the view on offer; and she will seize the opportunity to articulate, verbally and in writing, her own assessment of that view.\nMy job as a teacher of philosophy is to equip students with the resources they need to struggle fruitfully with philosophical texts\u0026mdash;in my lectures, in classroom activities, and in student assessment. I design my courses around a model of guided reading. On this model, students' first exposure to the content of an assigned text comes in lecture, where they are presented with concise definitions of the concepts and potted versions of the arguments they will encounter. I distribute slides of my lectures, which I instruct the students to use as an aid to spotting the relevant concepts and arguments as they read. While students often report having difficulty with the reading, they are just as often surprised at how much they\u0026rsquo;ve understood and how clearly they can relate these concepts and arguments in class discussion.\nI supplement this initial guided reading with a variety of classroom activities designed to reinforce and amplify students' comprehension. In one activity, students take turns as \u0026ldquo;lead discussants\u0026rdquo; of pairs of readings arguing on either side of a debate. The readings may be historical, for instance the letters of Descartes and Elisabeth of Bohemia on mind-body interaction; or they may be more contemporary, for instance Smart and Kripke on the identity theory of mind. As lead discussant, the student advocates for one of the opposed positions in class discussion, answering questions and responding to challenges from the other lead discussant, her peers, and me. Students prepare for this role by writing an \u0026ldquo;executive summary\u0026rdquo; of their reading and by rehearsing with me and the other lead discussant in office hours. Students generally report a positive experience as a lead discussant, and they seem to me remarkably fluent in their ability to explain and defend often subtle philosophical positions. Another activity involves tasking pairs of students with producing \u0026ldquo;fair copies\u0026rdquo; of class meetings, polished transcripts of lectures and class discussion compiled from the students' notes and corrected by me. The result is that students construct their own lecture notes as guides for reading and study.\nSimilar aims guide the design of my online and hybrid courses, in which I employ asynchronous methods to guide independent reading and synchronous methods to reinforce comprehension of main ideas of the text. Each unit of the course begins with a prerecorded video lecture introducing students to the topic and providing guides for engaging with the texts, with participation and basic comprehension assessed on the basis of short, multiple-choice quizzes integrated into the lecture. The students are asked to watch the lecture and begin reading the texts in advance of live discussion meetings with me and their peers. In advanced courses, the discussions are structured around student responses to reading questions submitted the day before and graded by me, as well as student presentations of secondary literature. Meetings in introductory courses are more variable in their structure, incorporating discussion of student questions, structured debates, and group activities.\nMy policies for student assessment likewise emphasize fruitful struggle with the assigned texts. An important evaluative tool in all of my courses is argument analysis, in which I ask students to clarify, reconstruct, and formulate objections to arguments in primary sources, following a model I illustrate in my lectures. I stress the importance of writing outlines and preliminary drafts, and I incentivize students to do so by offering to discuss and comment on early outlines and drafts. This policy is beneficial for two reasons. First, revising in light of my comments enables the student to clarify her own understanding of the relevant issues. Moreover, it gives me a basis for evaluating the student\u0026rsquo;s improvement in addition to the quality of the resulting paper. In general I prefer anonymous assessment of exams, but I try as much as possible to use a student\u0026rsquo;s improvement as a basis for evaluating her performance in assignments demanding critical engagement with philosophical texts.\nConsistently positive student feedback on this model testifies to its pedagogical efficacy. In evaluations of my courses, students regularly report that the lecture slides, as well as other \u0026ldquo;preparatory\u0026rdquo; material such as podcasts or YouTube videos, helped them understand the assigned readings and the content of the lectures; that acting as lead discussant enhanced their engagement with the material; and that class assignments such as regular reading responses and composing \u0026ldquo;scribe sheets\u0026rdquo; for the production of fair copies made a positive contribution to their learning experience. I am also encouraged by consistently positive feedback on my performance in the classroom: students often remark on my enthusiasm as a lecturer, my willingness to answer questions both inside and outside of the classroom, and my willingness to discuss and comment on drafts of their assignments. Most recently, in Spring 2020 the positive student feedback on my evaluations exceeded all College and University benchmarks, and in Spring 2019 I was recognized by the Koç University College of Social Sciences and Humanities for teaching excellence.\nAristotle claimed that teachers think they have achieved their goal when they observe their students actually doing what they have been taught. Rightly so. In my view the aim and chief pleasure of teaching philosophy is to observe students doing what they could not do before: reading, with increased understanding and appreciation, some of the great works of the discipline.\n","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043566,"objectID":"4ba7fdd815889a16653400e5faf45d45","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/dossier/statement/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/dossier/statement/","section":"dossier","summary":"For teachers and students alike, it is all too easy to regard the texts that make up the standard philosophical curriculum as artifacts, relics of views that were once compelling but have since\u0026mdash;perhaps long since\u0026mdash;been superseded.","tags":null,"title":"Teaching Statement","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PHL 340: Issues in Philosophy of Mind: Perception and Singular Thought  Raw Data\r\rQuantitative Feedback    Question Mean S.Dev.

Selected Qualitative Feedback  \u0026ldquo;Robert Howton, a PhD student in the department of Philosophy instructed the entire course. This was the first course he has ever taught. That being said, he did not exhibit any anxiety while instructing the course. He was well-versed in each of the covered topics, as was made evident in his explanation of the difficult subject matter. He provided clear and concise lecture handouts, which essentially covered all of the material in the class. Overall, I can confidently say that Robert Howton was, by far, my favorite instructor at the University of Toronto (PhD candidate, or otherwise).\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Prof. Howton had to teach this course on his own because Prof. Whiting was taking leave. In doing so however he was excellent. He provided us with extremely helpful outlines of his lectures, allowing me to keep attention on him while also adding things down on the handout. While he did sometimes go a bit fast, the minute anyone asked him to repeat a concept he would do so and make it ever the more clear. Though he\u0026rsquo;s a graduate student, I thoroughly enjoyed learning with him as my professor. He definitely demonstrated how interested and enthusiastic he was about the course material, and I would definitely take another course with him in the future. Great job.\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Great, explained clearly the topics. Everything was done slowly so everyone understands. There was a use of many examples. Small class so all questions were answered. Instructor helped out with any problem.\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Robert Howton is a fantastic instructor. The subject matter was very interesting and very intellectually stimulating.\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Robbie always provided a lot of support and tried to go slowly when concepts were unclear.\u0026rdquo;\n ","date":1543735420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574094096,"objectID":"dd1e380d9ea2c82f2b9ac625f2f51202","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/dossier/2014winter/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T10:23:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/dossier/2014winter/","section":"dossier","summary":"PHL 340: Issues in Philosophy of Mind: Perception and Singular Thought  Raw Data\r\rQuantitative Feedback    Question Mean S.Dev.
