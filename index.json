So far, however, no commentators have addressed\nAgainst recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination:  Answering these questions leads us to reject two claims central to many recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination in Aristotle:  That Aristotle regards being κριτική as essential to, or partially definitive of, αἴσθησις: see most recently Perälä, but also by Ebert, De Haas [CHECK Corcilius, Herzberg, Johansen] That Aristotle, in stressing that αἴσθησις is κριτική, is emphasizing that the power to perceive is, in some primary sense, a power to discriminate or tell apart sensible qualities and sensible bodies. (A line of interpretation initially proposed by Ebert but which has been accepted by all [?] subsequent interpreters.)   In contrast, I\u0026rsquo;ll argue that:  The power to discriminate is not a feature of the essence of the senses, but rather a demonstrable feature of them.\n Aristotle provides two arguments aimed at demonstrating that αἴσθησις is κριτική, one final causal and one formal causal:\n According to the final causal argument, αἴσθησις is and must be κριτική in order to promote the ends for whose sake it belongs to living things that have αἴσθησις:  αἴσθησις is present in all animals for the sake of survival and, ultimately, reproduction; the presence of αἴσθησις additionally promotes animals\u0026rsquo; cognitive function; finally, in humans, αἴσθησις is cited as the capacity from which potential knowers acquire knowledge of the indemonstrable principles of a demonstrative science.  According to the formal causal argument, αἴσθησις is κριτική because each sense (αἴσθησις) is a mean state of the opposition present in the qualities each perceives, and the mean is in every case κριτική.  Seen in the light of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s arguments, the conclusion that αἴσθησις is κριτική appears radically different: not an affirmation that perception is the cognition of difference but of the basic fidelity of the senses. For Aristotle, the senses are not only a source of knowledge; perception itself is a form of knowledge. And the basis for this claim is that perception, in its most basic form, is criterial for the presence of the sensible qualities it perceives; that perceivers, by virtue of having the capacity to perceive, occupy a privileged perspective with respect to the sensible objects and qualities of which they are critical.\n  Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s predecessors on perceptual κρίσις Anaxagoras Democritus Plato Aristotle in response to his predecessors Two arguments for perceptual κρίσις The final causal argument The formal causal argument Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Protagoreanism Concluding remarks The foregoing has sketched a fragment of a debate whose origin and terminus far exceed the scope of this paper. At its inception is a pre-Platonic skepticism about the reliability of the senses, at its terminus a sophisticated between skeptics and so-called dogmatists about the status of perception as a \u0026ldquo;criterion of truth\u0026rdquo; and source of knowledge. My hope is that this paper has shown that Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s case for the fidelity of the senses is more formative for this debate than we have previously acknowledged.\n CITE passages ^   ","date":1557910347,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1567703197,"objectID":"6968f96a0db909cf430c8fb8bc642fbd","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/post/krisis/","publishdate":"2019-05-15T11:52:27+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/krisis/","section":"post","summary":"Table of Contents Introduction In several passages of his natural scientific treatises, Aristotle expresses commitment to the thesis that sense-perception (aisthêsis) is kritikê, discriminative or (better, as I shall argue) criterial.1 Though it is nowhere presented as such, this is in fact one of the most controversial claims of his psychology: Aristotle is alone among his contemporaries and predecessors in affirming the thesis, whereas it was explicitly denied by almost all others who considered it (Text 1, Text 2, Text 3).","tags":[],"title":"Aristotle's Arguments for the Perceptual Criterion","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents HAHAHUGOSHORTCODE-TOC0-HBHB -- Course Description Philosophy in Western Europe underwent a dramatic shift in the 17th and 18th centuries. Spurred by the ongoing revolution in science and the rediscovery of some lost works of Classical Greek and Roman philosophy, philosophers of this period turned away from the scholastic disputes practiced in the universities of Europe to a whole new set of philosophical questions, including: What am I? How do I relate to my body? Is knowledge possible? If so, where does it come from? For proponents of this new approach to philosophy, exploration of these questions did not require extensive education or training, only the exercise of one\u0026rsquo;s inborn rational faculties. For this reason, philosophy in this period also witnessed another revolution: the increasing influence of women philosophers.\nThis course will introduce you to the major questions and figures of 17th and 18th century philosophy in Western Europe. We begin with René Descartes, arguably the most important thinker of the 17th century. Descartes\u0026rsquo; philosophical work posed the questions with which subsequent philosophers would wrestle. After looking at Descartes\u0026rsquo; answers to these questions, we\u0026rsquo;ll turn to those of his contemporaries and successors, including Malebranche, Cavendish, Leibniz, Berkeley, Locke, and Hume. Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll close our survey with a look at the most important philosopher of the 18th century: Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental philosophy represents the culmination of Descartes\u0026rsquo; philosophical legacy.\nCourse Objectives This course will emphasize close reading, analysis, and evaluation of basic philosophical works from the early modern period, with the aim of establishing a broad understanding of the philosophical controversies of that period and cultivating the skills necessary for appreciating these and other topics in philosophy. The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, philosophical ideas and questions, to read and critically assess philosophical literature, to identify the elements of an argument and assess it for soundness and validity, and to apply these skills to novel cases.  The key to success in this course is to keep up with the assigned readings and to attend and participate regularly in class activities.\n If you keep up with the lectures and readings you will not be assigned anything for which you are unprepared!   Course Components There are two basic components of this course, lectures and class discussion. Both components are mandatory, and both are moreover crucial for your success in this course.\nLectures The job of my lectures is to introduce you to the theories, concepts, and problems that make up the content of the course. These lectures will be accompanied by slide-show presentations, which I will share with you to use outside of lecture as a guide to reading the assigned texts. Hence, you will not be expected to come to the lecture having read the material assigned for that day, but you will be expected to have read the material prior to class discussion.\nClass Discussion Philosophy is a discursive enterprise: progress in understanding and evaluating philosophical ideas is most effectively made through interpersonal discussion, where you can test, correct, and improve your understanding of those ideas. To help you engage with philosophical ideas in this way, we will meet periodically for general class discussion of the topics recently introduced in the lecture. Upon arrival at these meetings, students will complete a short reading reflection on the texts assigned for that meeting.\nEvaluation Students will be expected to write two term tests and two term papers, as well as satisfy requirements for satisfactory participation in lectures and discussion meetings. With the exception of University excused absences, which must be supported by official documentation, students are expected to attend all other lectures and discussion meetings.\nAssignments Final grades will be determined according to the following rubric:\n   Assignment Percentage of Final Grade     Term Paper 1 15%   Term Paper 2 25%   Term Test 1 20%   Term Test 2 25%   Participation 15%   Total 100%     You must complete all assignments in order to pass the course!

For many epistemologists, both ancient and modern, whether and how knowledge is attainable depends on whether we possess some criterion or standard by which to judge what is the case from what merely appears to be the case. This idea, that knowledge requires a criterion of truth, has its origins in antiquity, in Hellenistic debates between so-called Dogmatists and Skeptics about whether human beings possess\u0026mdash;or can ever possess\u0026mdash;such a criterion. Our aim in this course will be to explore the ancient roots of this \u0026ldquo;problem of the criterion\u0026rdquo;, in order to gain a better understanding of the various arguments and positions of the dogmatic and skeptical Hellenistic schools, as well as the prehistory of this debate in Hellenic figures such as Protagoras, Democritus, and, more controversially, Plato and Aristotle.\nCourse Objectives The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in ancient epistemology and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and other issues in ancient and contemporary philosophy.\nLearning Outcomes The successful student will demonstrate the ability:\n to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to ancient epistemology, to read and critically assess relevant primary and secondary literature, to apply these skills to novel cases.

Course Components Students\u0026rsquo; success in meeting these course goals will be evaluated on the following bases:\n Undergraduate students will be expected to write two passage commentaries. The commentaries are designed to stimulate in-depth historical and philosophical engagement with one of the major passages discussed in class and relevant secondary literature.\n Graduate students will be expected to write either a passage commentary and a 12\u0026ndash;15 page final paper or a 20 page final paper. The final paper will address a substantive interpretive issue concerning Hellenistic epistemology and/or related philosophical issues. Topics and secondary literature will be selected in consultation with me.\n Class participation will be evaluated on the basis of the student\u0026rsquo;s answer to periodic reading response questions, which will be distributed in advance and must be turned in prior to the start of the meeting in which the relevant reading is to be discussed. (Students may opt out of reading responses with no penalty a maximum of three times; students who do not opt out of three reading responses may use these to replace lower-scoring responses; with the exception of University excused absences, which must be supported by official documentation, students must complete all other reading responses and attend all other class meetings.)\n Finally, students will give at least one 10\u0026ndash;15 minute in-class presentation.

I argue that the explanatory role of the soul in Aristotle’s natural science must be understood in light of his view, stated in a controversial passage from _Parts of Animals_ (645b14–20), that the soul of a living thing is a “complex activity” of its organic body. This paper explores the role of this “complex activity” model of soul in Aristotle’s study of soul in _De Anima_. I argue, first, that the model has its origins in _De Anima_ II.4, where Aristotle argues that living things do all they do by nature for the sake of a single, teleologically primary end. I argue further that Aristotle uses this model to account for the psychological attributes naturally present in living things, including their capacities for vital activities like nutrition, reproduction, and perception, and that this is the task to which Aristotle devotes the obscure final chapters of _De Anima_ III.","tags":null,"title":"Why De Anima Needs III 12-13","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543082192,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567703197,"objectID":"b698f3babed0ad211aabea2757b36ee4","permalink":"https://www.roberthowton.com/teaching/aristotles_soul/","publishdate":"2018-11-24T18:56:32+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/aristotles_soul/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":["Past Courses"],"title":"Aristotle's Soul","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" How to Write a Philosophy Paper The Goal of a Philosophy Paper Question What makes a philosophy paper successful?\n Answer A successful philosophy paper does two things:   1. It makes an argument for a specific claim; i.e., it defends a thesis!   2. The argument it makes is intelligible and convincing to the reader as well.  Planning a Successful Philosophy Paper   Step 1: Select a thesis     Exercise: What theses address the TP1 prompt?  How does Descartes reply to the \"Cartesian Circle\" objection in his Objections \u0026 Replies? In your view, is his reply successful? Why or why not?   Step 2: Develop an argument for that thesis.   Three forms of argument  1. Deductive [Must be Valid and Sound!]  All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Moose is a dog. Moose does not have fleas. Therefore, not all dogs have fleas.   Three forms of argument  2. Inductive [Sample Must be Representative!] a, b, c, and d are all Fs which are also G. Therefore, all Fs are Gs.   Three forms of argument 3. Abductive [Must be Best Available Explanation!] Increase in carbon emissions correlates with increasingly rapid climate change; there is no other correlation which could better explain increasingly rapid climate change; therefore, increase in carbon emissions causes climate change.   Exercise: What argument(s) support the theses that address the TP1 prompt? (Hint: by identifying the form of argument Descartes is giving, we can develop a strategy for supporting or undermining it.)   Step 3: Construct an outline   (Hint: your outline should present the argument in a way that your peers can understand.)   Elements of an outline I. Introduction Introduces the problem/question; draws in the reader; states thesis.   Elements of an outline II. Exegesis [Optional] Adds any other relevant information that the reader must know in order to understand the argument to come.   Elements of an outline III. Body States, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the argument for the thesis.   Elements of an outline IV. Conclusion Provides extremely brief restatement of thesis and argument for it; convinces the reader of the significance of the paper's conclusion(s)   Exercise: Construct an outline for the TP1 thesis you've chosen. (Hints: If you're arguing that Descartes' argument is successful, why is the most convincing argument against his conclusion incorrect? If you're arguing that his argument is unsuccessful, where does the argument go wrong?)   Step 4: Fill in your outline with complete sentences   (Hint: Ideally, the most nested items in each \"stem\" of your outline will correspond to a single paragraph.)  Developing Philosophical Writing Skills Tips for Writing Philosophy  Get to the point! (No \u0026ldquo;since the dawn of time\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;) Write plainly!

Argument reconstructions  Take an argumentative passage, identify the premises and conclusion, and restate the argument in your own words.   Sample Passage 1: Objections My only remaining concern is whether the author does not commit a vicious circle when he says that we have no other basis on which to establish that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true, than that God exists. But we can be certain that God exists only because we clearly and evidently perceive this fact. Therefore, before we are certain that God exists, we ought to be certain that whatever we clearly and evidently perceive is true.   Sample Passage 2: Replies I drew a distinction between what we are actually perceiving clearly and what we recall having clearly perceived sometime earlier. For first of all it is manifest to us that God exists, since we are attending to the arguments that prove this; but later on, it is enough for us to recall our having clearly perceived something in order to be certain that it is true. This would not suffice, unless we knew that God exists and does not deceive us.

The reason may not be obvious. For one thing, philosophy in Europe is far \\emph{older} than the \\nth{17} century; it stretches at least as far back as the ancient Greeks in the \\nth{6} century CE, perhaps even further, finding its ultimate roots in the speculations of ancient Egyptians and Babylonians centuries before. For another thing, the Western European philosophical tradition has \\emph{continued} far beyond the \\nth{18} century, and still persists in our \\nth{21} century. But while the \\nth{17} and \\nth{18} centuries occupy only a small portion of the vast history of philosophy in the West, the thinkers who worked during this period have exerted an outsized influence on the Western philosophical tradition. Together, these thinkers introduced into the Western tradition a new way of doing philosophy, and introduced a new set of philosophical questions and problems. And they did so self-consciously: they saw themselves as breaking with the older tradition inherited from the middle ages, and as practicing an explicitly new form of philosophical inquiry. For these reasons these thinkers have been given the honorific title of \\emph{modern philosophers}, and the centuries in which they worked has come to be known as the \\emph{modern}, or \\emph{early modern}, period. Our goal this week is to get an idea of the intellectual background in which this break with philosophical tradition occurred. To do that, however, we must first get a grip on the intellectual scene in Western Europe before the early modern period. (I should note at the outset that I'll be painting with extremely broad strokes. I'm doing so to give you a serviceable grip on the intellectual milieu of Western Europe in the early modern period. Just keep in mind that many of the portraits I paint of pre-modern thought, especially that of Aristotle, are more like caricatures.)
